<h2><a id="INTRODUCTION"></a>INTRODUCTION.</h2>
</div>

<p>The Electric Telegraph is unquestionably one of our
most valuable public utilities.</p>

<p>In commercial life the telegraph has revolutionized
business methods. Transactions are now effected between
New York, London and other financial centres
in minutes, which formerly occupied weeks, and even
months, to accomplish. In social life the advantages
of telegraph communication are equally apparent;
travel where we may, we are always within reach of
friends or kindred at a distance by means of the telegraph
wires.</p>

<p>The daily Press is now enabled to record the moving
accidents on flood and field in all parts of the world, a
few hours or even minutes after their occurrence.</p>

<p>The dreadful catastrophe at Martinique, with the
loss of thousands of human lives; the fire in a Chicago
theatre, and the loss of hundreds of women and
children through culpable negligence; the shocking
loss of life on the excursion steamer “General
Slocum” through lack of life-saving appliances is
gruesome reading, but the public demand it; the
more pleasing event of King Edward’s visit to
President Loubet, on his mission of Peace, and the
return visit of the latter to London are a few examples
of news carried over the wires, all within the purview
of the humblest reader. There are few who cannot
afford the price of a daily paper, and thus keep in
touch with current events, but no very long time ago
a daily newspaper was beyond the reach of all but the
comparatively wealthy. The advent of the telegraph
with its multifarious budget of news from every
quarter of the Globe caused a large increase in circulation,
and a decrease in price naturally followed.</p>

<p>During the Crimean war, when telegraph communication
had been established with the army headquarters,
the working men of a manufacturing concern
near Glasgow, in which the writer was employed,
clubbed together to defray the cost of a daily newspaper,
the price then being four pence halfpenny, much
beyond the means of a single individual. During the
dinner hour he read to an interested and attentive
audience the latest despatches from the seat of war,
many of whom would forego dinner rather than miss
the daily pabulum of war news. Now all this is
changed, the poorest laboring man can afford the price
of a daily paper, formerly only enjoyed by his more
opulent countrymen.</p>

<p>Still earlier, Macaulay, in his History of England,
tells us of the news letter, the predecessor of the
modern newspaper, wherein he says: “The news
letter within a week after its arrival had been thumbed
over by twenty families, and furnished the neighboring
squires with matter for talk over their October,
and the Rector with topics for sharp sermons.”</p>

<p>The news letters were collated in London, for the
benefit of provincial readers. The price was no doubt
high, and the contents probably consisted of gossip
or scandal in high life, details of a cocking main, an
affair between my Lord Tomnoddy and a Captain of
the Blues, or affairs of Church and State. Now the
four quarters of the earth is ransacked daily and news
collected at immense labor and enormous cost by the
associated press, and retransmitted to all points of the
compass.</p>

<p>Wireless telegraphy, the latest marvel in applied
science, is surely and steadily forging ahead, and will
cover areas of land and sea, where the land and cable
wires do not operate.</p>

<p>The writer feels that no apology is necessary in publishing
the following brief outline of telegraph history,
a subject which he believes will interest both the old
as well as younger readers.</p>

<p>The data of English telegraph history is largely
derived from an early edition of the Encyclopaedia
Brittanica, while that of the American is taken from
a voluminous work published about a quarter of a
century ago, by James D. Reid, a friend and associate
of Professor Morse. The facts relating to Canadian
history are taken from original records, while that of
submarine and wireless telegraphy is from numerous
sources of contemporary literature and personal
knowledge.</p>

<p>While admitting there is nothing strikingly original
in the work, the writer ventures to hope that the style
will commend itself to those who prefer brevity to
wearisome detail.</p>

<h3><i>Telegraph History</i></h3>

<p>Telegraph, a machine for communicating intelligence
to a distance, usually by means of preconcerted
signals to which some convenient meaning
is attached.</p>

<p>The name Semiphore was also applied to some
of the machines used for effecting telegraphic communication,
which in an extended sense may be
considered to embrace every means of conveying
intelligence by gestures and visible signs, as flags,
lanterns, rockets, blue lights, beacon fires, etc., or
by audible signals as the firing of guns, the blowing
of trumpets, the beating of drums or gongs, as
well as by the machine specially provided for the
purpose.</p>

<p>Although telegraph communication as a means
of conveying any required intelligence is an invention
of recent date, the use of signals for the
speedy transmission of messages as might be previously
arranged between persons is a practice derived<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10">10</a></span>
from the most remote antiquity. The use
of beacon fires for example, as a means of giving
warning of the approach of an enemy, is alluded
to by the Prophet Jeremiah, who wrote about six
centuries before the Christian era, and who warns
the Benjamites to set up a sign of fire in Beth-Haccerem,
for evil appeareth out of the north and
great destruction (<cite>Jeremiah</cite> VI., 1).</p>

<p>The fine description given by Acchylus in his
Agamemnon, of the application of a line of fire
signals to communicate the intelligence of the fall
of Troy is often referred to as an early instance of
this kind of telegraphic dispatch.</p>

<p>This simple means of spreading an alarm, or
communicating intelligence, is described by Scott
in the “Lay of the Last Minstrel,” and in a note he
refers to an act of the Scottish Parliament in 1455,
c. 48, which directs that one bale or faggot shall
be the warning of the approach of the English in
any manner, two bales, that they are coming indeed,
and four bales blazing beside each other that
the enemy are in great force.</p>

<p>Such signals though best adapted to give information
by night, were also available in day time,
when they appeared as dense columns of smoke.</p>

<p>Torches held in the hand and moved in any particular
manner, or alternately displayed and hidden
behind a screen, were also used in ancient times as
signals.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11">11</a></span>
A night telegraph contrived by the Rev. James
Bremner, of the Shetland Islands, and rewarded by
the Society of Arts in 1816.</p>

<p>A single light constitutes the whole apparatus
and the whole operation consists in its alternate
exhibition and concealment. This plan had been
found suitable for distances of twenty miles and
upwards, and had been successfully put in operation
between the light-house on Copeland Island
and Port Patrick, on the opposite side of the Irish
Channel.</p>

<h3><i>Telegraph Electric</i></h3>

<p>The attempts to render one or other of the phenomena
of electricity subservient to the purposes
of telegraphy have been numerous. From the
earliest date, which we can assign to the existence
of an electric telegraph, its essential parts have
been the same. There are: 1st, the source of electrical
power; 2nd, the conducting material by which
this power is enabled to travel to the required
locality; and, 3rd, the apparatus by which at the
distant end of the line the existence of this power,
its amount or the direction of its action is made
known to the observer.</p>

<p>In the earlier stages of the invention, the investigations
of its promoters were confined to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12">12</a></span>
last of these three essentials, and, so long as the
illustration of the idea was confined to the lecture
table, this part claimed pre-eminence, but with the
proposed application to purposes of general utility
there arose the necessity for an equal degree of
attention to the two former requisites.</p>

<p>The experiments of Dr. Watson, in England, in
1747, and of Franklin, in 1748, on the banks of the
Schuylkill river may have suggested the conveyance
of information by means of electricity.</p>

<p>The earliest authenticated instance of any attempt
to reduce this to practice appears to have
been that of Lesage, of Geneva, in 1774, and of
Lomond, in France, in 1787, they employed as an
indicator a pair of pith balls suspended from one
end of an insulated wire, and at the other end of
which was the operator provided with an electric
machine, on charging the wire with electricity, the
pith balls would exercise mutual repulsion and
divergence from one another, but on removing the
electrical charge from the wire by the contact of
some conductor the balls would collapse.</p>

<p>It is evident that certain numbers of successive
divergences might be made to denote particular
preconcerted signals.</p>

<p>Subsequently to this the phenomena of the spark,
as seen on the passage of electricity through an
uninterrupted conductor, was used for the transmission<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13">13</a></span>
of signals, were the various letters of the
alphabet formed in this manner upon a table and
connected with each one with a distinct and insulated
wire and a particular letter might be rendered
visible in a darkened room by passing an electric
charge through the appropriate wire, this in fact
constituted the telegraph of Reusser or Reiser invented
in 1794.</p>

<p>Retancourt and Dr. Salva, in 1798, appear to
have made experiments on the transmission of the
charge through wires of great length.</p>

<p>A somewhat similar form of apparatus involving
the same principle was constructed by arranging
the several wires in succession with a single break
in each. The various wires bore the names of the
different letters or figures, and any required signal
was indicated by passing the charge through the
proper wire, when the spark visible at the interruption
of the circuit would denote the letter to
the observer at the farther end. This was the
point to which invention had advanced at the commencement
of the nineteenth century.</p>

<p>The discovery of Volta in 1800, of the Pile, which
bears his name forms the commencement of a new
era in electric telegraphs. Although there was no
immediate application of the phenomena of the
galvanic current to the purpose, indeed several important
discoveries had to be made before an electric
telegraph of any value was possible.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14">14</a></span>
In 1807 Sommering, at Munich, proposed to construct
an electric telegraph on the principle of the
decomposition of water, by the Voltaic current discovered
in 1800, by Nicholson and Carlisle. The
form of apparatus was the following:</p>

<p>In a glass trough containing water, thirty-five
gold pegs or pins were arranged vertically, this
number of pegs corresponding to the letters of the
alphabet together with the nine digits; each of
those pins was connected by a wire which extended
to the place whence the signal was to be transmitted;
at this point they terminated in brass strips
arranged in a frame side by side, but like the wires
and pins insulated from each other, each brass strip
bore the name of the letter or figure which belonged
to the pin to which it was connected. The
operator, when wishing to send any communication,
connected the two poles of the battery with the
brass strips bearing the names of the two first
letters required&mdash;decomposition of the water in the
trough at the distant end was instantly indicated
by the evolution of bubbles of gas from the two
gold pins which thus became the two electrodes or
poles of the battery. The letters forming any
communication were to be in this manner denoted
in pairs, the inventor ingeniously availing himself
of the different quantities of the two gases,
evolved to point out the relative position of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15">15</a></span>
letters in each pair, the hydrogen being employed
to indicate the first letter.</p>

<p>Schweigger proposed to add to this system a
plan for calling the attention of the correspondent
at the distant station by the discharge by the current
of a pistol charged with the mixed gases.</p>

<p>In 1816 Mr. Ronalds, of Hammersmith, invented
an electric telegraph in which the use of frictional
electricity was recurred to.</p>

<p>This telegraph, which was shown to several
scientific men at the date above given, was fully
described by the inventor by a work published by
him in 1823.</p>

<p>Mr. Ronalds employed the divergence and collapse
of a pair of pith balls as the telegraphic indication
in which respect the principle was the same
as that adopted by Mr. Lomond, but to this simple
apparatus a distinct contrivance was appended in
order to render the communication more rapid and
easy.</p>

<p>A single wire, perfectly insulated by being suspended
by silken strings, or buried in glass tubes,
surrounded by pitch and protected by wooden
troughs, was extended between the stations; from
the end of this wire was suspended in front of the
dial of a clock, a pair of pith balls so that whilst
the wire was charged the balls would remain divergent,
but would instantly collapse when the wire<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16">16</a></span>
by contact with the earth, or with the hand of the
operator was discharged.</p>

<p>A person at one end having, therefore, an electrical
machine, by which he could maintain the wire
in an electrified state and the pith balls at the other
extremity, consequently, in a state of divergence, had
it, of course, in his power to give an instantaneous
indication to the observer at that farther extremity
by touching the wire with the hand, which, discharging
the electricity, would allow the balls to collapse
for an instant; but instead of merely employing the
successive movements of the pith balls to denote
the various signals, Mr. Ronalds added another
apparatus for the purpose.</p>

<p>Two clocks, very accurately adjusted to the same
rate of going, carried, instead of the ordinary seconds
hands, light discs, on which the various letters
of the alphabet, the figures and other required
signals were engraved. These discs turned with a
regular step-by-step movement behind a screen of
metal in which was made a small opening, sufficient
to allow one letter at a time being seen. As the
discs turned round each letter in succession would
be visible through this space, and it is evident that
if the clocks started with the same signal visible,
the movement of the discs would bring similar
signals into view at the same time.</p>

<p>One of these instruments was situated at each
end of the communicating wire.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17">17</a></span>
The operator who was about to transmit any
communication watched the dial of his clock until
the letter he required was visible and at that instant
discharged the wire; the momentary collapse of
the balls at the distant end would then warn the
observer to note the letter visible on his instrument
which would form a part of the intelligence to be
received, the successive letters or signals constituting
any messages were denoted in this manner, as
the clock dials continued to turn round.</p>

<p>In order to avoid the constant attention on the
part of the observer an arrangement was adopted
by which a pistol could be fired by the spark of the
further end to summon the attendant to his instrument.</p>

<p>Various signals were also concerted before hand,
by the use of which the time necessary for the
transmission of any intelligence was lessened.</p>

<p>These experiments of Mr. Ronalds were made
with the intervention of several miles of wire carried
backward and forward across his grounds.</p>

<p>In 1819 Professor Oersted, of Copenhagen, made
his great discovery of the action of the galvanic
current upon a magnetic needle; he observed that
when a current is passed along a wire placed parallel
and near a magnetic needle free to turn on
its centre, the needle is deflected to one side or the
other according to the direction in which the current
is transmitted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18">18</a></span>
He further noticed that the position of the wire,
whether above or below the needle, had an equal
influence with the direction of the current in determining
the side to which the deflection took place.
The power of a single wire in causing this deviation
of a needle is but small, but this was remedied by
the invention of the multiplier or galvanometer by
Prof. Schweigger, in which the needle being surrounded
with many successive coils of insulated
wire, is acted upon by the joint force of all. Under
a somewhat different form this discovery now forms
the basis of the needle electric telegraph.</p>

<p>Very shortly after this important discovery had
been made, Arago and Ampère, in France, and
Seebeck, in Berlin, succeeded in rendering iron
magnetic by the passage of a galvanic current
through a wire coiled around the iron, and Sturgeon,
in England, produced the first electro-magnet.
It was found that provided the iron to be magnetized
were perfectly soft and pure, the magnetic
property remained only during the actual transmission
of the electricity, and was lost immediately
on the interruption of the electric current.</p>

<p>If the iron which was exposed to the influence
of the galvanic current were combined with sulphur,
carbon or phosphorus, the magnetic power
became to a greater or less extent permanent in it.</p>

<p>The invention of the Voltaic battery, of the deflection<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19">19</a></span>
of the needle, and of the magnetization of
soft iron, formed the three great steps in the history
of the electric telegraph.</p>

<p>M. Ampère suggested the employment of the
discovery of Oersted as early as 1830, and this suggestion
was acted upon by Prof. Ritchie, in a model
telegraph exhibited by him at the Royal Institution.</p>

<p>Ampère’s plan, however, was far from possessing
the simplicity so essential to an instrument designed
for practical use; not less than thirty pairs of
conducting wires were necessary according to his
scheme for maintaining a telegraph communication.</p>

<p>Baron Schilling in 1832 and 1833, following the
idea originated by Ampère, proposed a similar form
of telegraph in which there were as many of these
galvanometers, each with its appropriate circuit, as
there were letters or signs to be used in the various
communications, in fact, there were 30 needles and
72 wires.</p>

<p>In 1833 Gauss and Weber proposed to employ
the separate movements of a suspended bar as
signals, but its indication must have been feeble as
they had to be observed through a telescope placed
at some distance from the oscillating bar.</p>

<p>In 1837 M. Alexander exhibited a model of a
proposed form of telegraph containing twenty-five
needles to be acted upon as in Ampère’s arrangement.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20">20</a></span>
In this instrument a distinct needle was employed
for the indication of each letter, these needles
bearing at one end light screens of paper which
concealed from view a letter or figure until by the
deflection of the needle the screen was removed,
and the letter brought into sight.</p>

<p>M. Alexander, however, effected one great improvement
in substituting a single wire to which
one end of all the coils was joined for the several
return wires existing in the previous invention of
M. Schilling.</p>

<p>At a later period this gentleman undertook a
series of experiments with a view to the establishment
of a communication by means of a single wire,
but some mechanical difficulties appear to have
arrested his progress.</p>

<p>In both of these telegraphs, all that was required
in addition to the indicating apparatus and conducting
wires, was a contrivance by which the connection
of the Voltaic batteries could be made with
any pair of wires, in the former, and with any
single wire and the return conductor in the latter
of the two inventions. One pole of the battery
being connected to the return or common wire,
the other pole of the battery was joined to a plate
of metal, or to a trough of mercury, extending
beneath all the keys. On depressing any key the
wire belonging to it, which was continued to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21">21</a></span>
end over the battery connection, was brought into
contact with this bar or trough. The current would
then flow along the conducting wire, around the
multiplier coil in the distant instrument, and return
by the common wire to the Voltaic battery. The
keys bore the same letters as the needles to which
they were connected, so that the operator communicated
any letter by pressing down the corresponding
key.</p>

<p>In these two instruments, no use was made of
the power which exists of determining the deflection
of the needle to either side by merely reversing
the connections of the battery.</p>

<p>We have thus traced the history of the telegraph
up to the point at which it first assumed the practical
form of Cooke and Wheatstone’s inventions,
but what had been accomplished remained either
unknown, or was known only to a few leading men
of science, until the unexpected development of the
electric telegraph in the hands of these gentlemen
led each one who was in possession of any title to
the merit of having believed in and experimented
upon the possibility to produce his title, or to have
it eagerly put forward by his friends and fellow
countrymen.</p>

<p>Although the principal facts necessary to the
construction of an electric telegraph had been
known ever since 1821, yet it was not until the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22">22</a></span>
general establishment of railways that telegraph
wires could be safely carried to any great distance.</p>

<p>Moreover, the importance of the invention was
by no means understood.</p>

<p>In 1837 the experiments of Cooke and Wheatstone,
which had been progressing for more than
a twelvemonth, appeared so far successful as to induce
them to apply for a patent for their inventions.</p>

<p>The instrument which was brought into use on
the Great Western Railway shortly after the date
of the patent, contained five needles, arranged with
their axis in a horizontal line. The needles when
at rest hung vertically, by reason of a slight preponderence
given to the lower ends, each coil was
connected with one of the long conducting wires at
one end, and was united at the other, with a rod
of metal, which joined together the similar ends of
all the coils.</p>

<p>The current was transmitted from the opposite
end of the wires where a set of five pair of finger
keys for making the connections with the battery
was placed through two of the wires at once, that
is to say, of the wire of which one key was pressed
down, served to convey the current from one pole
of the battery to the distant instrument, while the
key of a second wire being brought into contact
with the other pole, the current returned by the
rod of metal connecting the coils, and the second
wire to the battery again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23">23</a></span>
Two needles were in this manner deflected at
once, and it will be obvious, that the current would
pass in opposite directions around their coils, and,
consequently, that the deflection must be in contrary
directions. The needles would, therefore,
converge either above or below their line of centre
as one or other of the pair of keys belonging to
each wire was depressed, fixed stops were so placed
on each side of the needles, as to limit their motion
and when resting against them the needles were
parallel to two converging lines, at the point of
intersection of movement of the needles.</p>

<p>In a similar manner as lines were drawn diverging
from the centre of each axis mutually crossing
one another, a number of points of intersection
were formed at each of which was a letter or signal.
Any of these letters could be indicated by the
simultaneous movement of two needles, so that a
communication could be carried on with certainty
and tolerable rapidity, at the same time a plan was
recognized by which the number of wires requisite
for maintaining a communication might be reduced
by using one of them at times as a return wire only,
there being no needle in connection with this one.</p>

<p>One needle could, by the use of this wire, be
deflected by itself, either to the right, or to the left,
and thus, of course, each would furnish two signals
in addition to those formed by its simultaneous<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24">24</a></span>
deflection by any other. The instruments at the
two stations were always rendered reciprocating;
that is, at each end of the line were placed at each
instrument a set of finger keys and a Voltaic battery,
so that either station could transmit, or receive
a signal by an ingenious arrangement. The keys
on being released after depression, were made to
resume by themselves the position necessary to
enable that which had been the signalling station
to become the recipient; by this means messages
and answers or words and their acknowledgment
could follow one another without the necessity for
any intervening adjustment of the instruments.</p>

<p>The bell or alarum which was to be rung, when
the attention of the clerk at the distant end was
required, was either direct or indirect in its action.</p>

<p>In the first case, the attraction exercised by a
horseshoe-shaped piece of soft iron, rendered temporarily
magnetic by the galvanic current, was
made to draw an armature likewise of soft iron towards
it, and by this action impel a small hammer
against a bell.</p>

<p>In the second form of alarum the movement of
the armature merely released a detent or catch from
a train of clock work driven by a spring or weight.
This clock work by the intervention of a scape
wheel and pallets rang the bell as in a common
alarum.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25">25</a></span>
In April, 1838, Mr. Cooke obtained a patent for
some further improvements in this apparatus.</p>

<p>The electric telegraph invented by Prof. Morse,
of the United States, has led to a large amount of
controversy, a claim having been put in for him as
the first actual invention of a practical electric
telegraph in 1832, while on board the packetship
“Sully.”</p>

<p>The Abbe Moigne states that a Mr. Jackson
wrote to the Academie Française, affirming that he
had in 1832 communicated the plan to Mr. Morse
while returning together from Europe to America
on board the “Sully.”</p>

<p>Even admitting, however, the claim of either
party, it would only show that they did not think
sufficiently well of their scheme to enter upon it
until nearly three months after the first English
patent for an electric telegraph had been sealed and
the practicability of such an apparatus had been
demonstrated in England.</p>

<p>The first really official letter on the subject from
Prof. Morse is dated September 27, 1837.</p>

<p>Cooke and Wheatstone’s first patent for an electric
telegraph was sealed three months before this,
namely, on June 12, 1837.</p>

<p>The difference between this telegraph and the
preceding, in suggestions and contrivances, was
very great. The experiments of these gentlemen had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26">26</a></span>
been proceeding for a long time previously, so that
when in June, 1837, their patent was obtained, it
was not for an arrangement of doubtful practicability,
or of a form to be perfected only after
repeated trial; on the contrary, it was within a few
months after the date of the patent put up and
brought into actual and daily use.</p>

<p>Some of its details have since been simplified,
and the modes in which the electric needles are made
to give the required indications have been greatly
varied, but the great features and principles of their
first invention remain unchanged, and not only so,
but they form an essential part of nearly, if not
quite all, the later telegraphs of other inventors.</p>

<p>The invention of an electric telegraph should
have attracted the immediate attention of railway
managers, one would naturally suppose; on the
contrary, railway directors looked upon it as a new-fangled
invention, and the public was not yet alive
to its innumerable advantages. One fact, however,
must be insisted on and is now a matter of history&mdash;that
to England belongs the honor of this great invention;
that in the year 1837, a needle telegraph
had been invented so complete, and at the same
time so simple in its operations, that it could be
worked by any one who knew how to read; that
in June of that year the patent for this telegraph
had been sealed, and a month later the wires were<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27">27</a></span>
laid down between Euston Square and Camdentown
Stations of the North Western Railway, a
distance of a mile and a quarter, and that on the
25th of July messages were actually sent between
these two stations, Prof. Wheatstone being in the
Euston Square Station, and Mr. Cooke being in
that at Camdentown, the witnesses being the engineers,
Messrs. Fox and Stephenson.</p>

<p>Now, it is quite true that Arago claimed before
the French Academy of Sciences for Mr. Steinheil
the precedence in this matter, inasmuch as he had
his telegraph in operation on the 19th of July, 1837;
but it must be remembered that Wheatstone’s
patent was taken out in June of that year, and was
publicly shown on numerous previous experiments,
all of which were successful, whereas Mr. Steinheil
published no description of his instrument until
August, 1838, and it is admitted that in the interval
he had altered and amended his instrument and
soon after abandoned it for a modification of one
by Morse.</p>

<p>In September, 1837, he exhibited an imperfect
instrument, although he afterwards succeeded in
producing one of first rate excellence, which is still
largely used in the United States.</p>

<p>Cooke and Wheatstone received notice to quit
the London and Birmingham line, but Mr. Brunel
gave them permission, in 1839, to lay it down on the
Great Western Railway. This was first done as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28">28</a></span>
far as West Drayton, 13 miles, and afterwards extended
to Slough, 18 miles, the wires in both of
these preliminary trials being enclosed in iron tubes
laid on the ground.</p>

<p>On proposing to extend this line to Bristol much
opposition was offered by the directors, and the
telegraph again had notice to quit, but on the proposal
of Mr. Cooke to retain the wires at his own
expense, he was permitted to do so on condition of
transmitting the Railway signals free of charge,
and of extending the line to Slough. In return
for this favor, he was allowed to transmit messages
for the public, which was accordingly done, one
shilling being charged for a message, but the public
did not avail themselves of the new instrument, and
its value was scarcely appreciated until the 3rd of
January, 1845, when it was used to convey a message
to London police, directing them to arrest one
Towell, on a charge of murder. The message
flashed past the criminal while he was travelling
express to escape the consequence of his crime.</p>

<p>By the end of 1845 upwards of 500 miles of line
were in operation in England.</p>

<p>In 1846 the Electric Telegraph Company commenced
its operations with a considerable capital,
a large portion of which was expended in the purchase
of Wheatstone and Cooke’s patents, and the
system which they had introduced became rapidly
extended.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29">29</a></span>
In due time other telegraph companies were
competing with the original company, namely, the
Electric &amp; International Telegraph Company, and
the London &amp; Provincial Telegraph Co. The
system spread over Europe and soon no railway
was deemed complete without its telegraph wires.</p>

<p>On the 5th of February, 1870, the Monopoly conferred
upon the postmaster general, by the telegraph
act of the previous year, took effect when the
Post-Office assumed control of telegraph communication
within the United Kingdom, and it then
became possible to send telegrams throughout the
country at a uniform charge irrespective of locality
or distance.</p>

<p>The purchase money paid to the telegraph companies,
compensation to railway companies for
their interest in the telegraph business and the
expense of new lines amounted to upwards of ten
millions sterling.</p>

<p>On the day of the transfer a thousand post-offices
and nineteen hundred railway stations were opened
as telegraph offices. The public at once showed
their appreciation of the change.</p>

<p>In the year 1869 but seven millions of telegrams
passed on the companies wires; in 1870 the postmaster
general transmitted ten millions.</p>

<p>In 1885 the sixpenny telegrams were introduced.
The charge for a written telegram, which came into<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30">30</a></span>
force in 1870, was one shilling for the first twenty
words, and threepence for every additional five
words, the addresses of sender and receiver being
sent free.</p>

<p>In 1885 the charge was reduced to a half-penny
a word throughout including addresses (a system
of abbreviated addresses, which could be registered
on payment of a guinea a year, was introduced),
with a minimum charge of sixpence; the effect of
this reduction was to run the number of telegrams
in two years from thirty-three to fifty millions.</p>

<p>During the first six months the number of telegrams
increased by 48 per cent., while the gross
telegraph revenue fell off to the extent of £40,233
though £18,124 had been received in respect to abbreviated
addresses.</p>

<p>In April, 1886, the telegrams in excess of 1885
amounted to 40 per cent., but the revenue was
£11,800 less. In May the increase in telegrams
was 51 per cent. and the revenue £4,100 less than
the previous May.</p>

<p>In June the increase was 61 per cent. and the revenue
£2,800 less. The working expenses were
thus increased, while the receipts were diminished.
In London alone the receipts fell off by as much
as 74 per cent. The principal reasons for the unfavorable
financial results of the working of the
telegraph are: the large price £10,130,000 expended<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31">31</a></span>
as purchase money, an argument of little
weight so long as working expenses are not paid;
the right accorded to railway companies at the
time of the transfer of sending postal telegrams
free of all charge. The number of these telegrams,
at first insignificant, reached a total of 1,600,000 in
1891, with an average length of 25 words, representing
a value of £80,000 a year. Arrangements were
afterwards made under which the companies would
surrender this privilege in return for permission to
send a fixed number of free telegrams in the course
of the year.</p>

<p>The loss on press telegrams, to quote the forty-first
report of the postmaster general: “A still more
serious burden is caused by the loss on press telegrams.”</p>

<p>The charge specified in the Telegraph Act of
1868 for press telegrams is one shilling for 75
words during the day, or one hundred words at
night, but a proviso was added that for copies only
2<i>d</i> per 75 words in the day or 100 at night, and no
condition was laid down as to the copy being for
the same town as the original; the newspaper, accordingly,
combined to receive from the news associations
messages in identical terms, and by dividing
the cost they are enabled to get the benefit of
a rate which comes nearer 2<i>d</i> than a shilling, the
average charge being in fact about four pence half-penny
per 100 words.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32">32</a></span>
Notwithstanding the economical arrangements
which have been made for the transmission of press
telegrams, 5,400,000 in number containing 650,000,000
words, the loss incurred by the Post-Office in
dealing with them is estimated to amount to £300,000
per annum.</p>

<p>The reductions in the tariff, especially in 1885
and 1897, and the competition of the telephone (upwards
of 450,000,000 messages a year, transmitted
by the National Telephone Company alone), though
it must be remembered that the Royalties of the
companies exceeded £100,000 per annum, which
figure among the receipts of the Post-Office telegraph
service. The increased wages paid to telegraphists
in 1880 and 1881, the wages and salaries
represented 44 per cent. of the total revenue; they
now exceed 66 per cent. The real success of the
state administration of the telegraph lies not in any
contribution to the revenue, but in cheap telegrams
and a large use of the service.</p>

<p>The average price of the ordinary inland telegram
is sevenpence, three farthings, and there are
more telegrams sent in the United Kingdom, both
positively and relatively than in any other country,
with the possible exception of the United States.</p>

<p>For every 100 persons there are sent in the
United Kingdom 184 telegrams, while in France
there are but 108 and in Germany 66.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33">33</a></span>
In 1901 the gross revenue was £3,380,589. The
pay of a telegraphist in London rises to £160 a year,
with the prospect of promotion to higher positions.</p>

<p>The number of telegrams transmitted in 1900&ndash;1
was 89,576,000.</p>

<p>In small towns and villages where the traffic is
light, and a skilled telegraphist is unnecessary, the
Wheatstone A.&nbsp;B.&nbsp;C. instrument is used; in this
apparatus electric currents are generated by turning
a handle (placed in front of the instrument)
which is geared to a Siemens shuttle armature
placed between the two arms of a powerful horseshoe
magnet; when one of a series of keys (each corresponding
to a letter), arranged around a pointer,
is depressed, motion of the pointer which is geared
to the shuttle armature is arrested on coming opposite
that particular key and the transmission of
the currents to line is stopped, though the armature
itself can continue to rotate. The depression of a
second key causes the first key to be raised, the
currents actuate a ratchet wheel mechanism at
the receiving station, whereby the hand on a small
dial is moved on letter by letter.</p>

<p>At offices where the work is heavier than can be
dealt with by the A.B.C. apparatus, the single
needle instrument is very largely used.</p>

<p>It has the advantage of slight liability to derangement
and of requiring very little adjustment. A fairly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34">34</a></span>
skilled operator can signal with it at the rate of
twenty words a minute.</p>

<p>The needle (in the modern pattern) is of soft iron
and is kept magnetized inductively by the action
of two permanent steel magnets. The coils are
wound with copper wire (covered with silk) to a
total resistance of 200 ohms. The actual current
required to work the instrument is 3-3 milliampères
equivalent approximately to the current given by
one Daniel cell through 3,300 ohms, but in practice
a current of 10 milliampères is allowed.</p>

<p>A single but important addition to enable the
reading from the instrument to be effected by
sound, in this arrangement the needle strikes against
small tubes formed of tin plate and by this means
the movement of the needle to the right or left is
quite audible.</p>

<p>The Wheatstone automatic apparatus is largely
used, especially for press matter; through it a speed
of 600 letters per minute can be obtained.</p>

<p>In the Rowland multiple method, the transmitter
consists of a mechanical key board, provided with
a series of levers which effect certain combinations
of positive and negative currents for each letter:
these currents are furnished by an alternator, which
transmits sine currents over the line, both machines
running in synchronism.</p>

<p>At the receiving end of the circuit a shaft is coupled<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35">35</a></span>
to the motor; this is provided with gearing
which rotates four combining commutators and
four type wheels, which print the letters on the
band of paper. There are four transmitters and
four receivers, which are operated independently
by means of an adaptation of the multiplex system
of working, and each circuit is provided with a
number of segments set apart for its own use. Each
transmitter is, therefore, able to transmit a separate
series of positive and negative currents in
different combinations; these are distributed by
suitably arranged distributors and relays at the
receiving end of the line into their respective receivers.
The function of the “combiner” in each
receiving instrument is to group the received combinations
of positive and negative currents that they
operate polarized relays in such a manner that the
position of the tongues corresponds with the operation
of the levers in the transmitter, since each
letter is represented by a specific combination of
positive and negative currents.</p>

<p>It is possible by means of the combinations to
close a local circuit at any given interval and so
cause the paper to be pressed against the periphery
of the type wheel at the time when the letter required
is opposite.</p>

<p>The paper is also caused to advance automatically
for each letter, start a first line, and also to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36">36</a></span>
commence a fresh form at the completion of each
message.</p>

<p>The Delaney Multiples System, which has been
adopted to a limited extent in Great Britain,
enables a large amount of work to be done on one
wire.</p>

<p>Between London and Manchester four sets of
the apparatus can be worked, but between London
and Birmingham, a shorter distance, six sets (the
maximum for which the system is adopted) may be
used.</p>

<h3><i>Sir William Fothergill Cooke</i>,<br />
<span class="subhead">1806&ndash;1879.</span></h3>

<p>Son of William Cooke, M.D., Durham, was born
at Ealing, Middlesex, and having received his
education at Durham, was appointed in 1826 to
the East Indian army, in which he held various staff
appointments till 1831.</p>

<p>On his return home he devoted his time to the
study of anatomy and physiology at Paris and
Heidleberg and to modelling anatomical dissections
for the illustration of his father’s lectures at Durham
University.</p>

<p>In March, 1836, he began to direct his attention
to the electric telegraph, with which he occupied
himself exclusively for many years.</p>

<p>He entered into partnership with Prof. Wheatstone,
and formed in conjunction with Mr. Ricardo,
M.P., the first telegraph company of which he
became a director.</p>

<p>The first telegraph line in England was constructed
by Mr. Cooke, from Paddington to West
Drayton, on the Great Western Railway in 1837.</p>

<p>In 1840 he established the telegraph on the
Blackwall Railway, and in 1841 a short line from
the Queen Street station, at Glasgow, through the
tunnel to the engine house at Cowlairs on the railway
to Edinburgh.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38">38</a></span>
In 1842 the line from West Drayton was continued
to Slough, and in 1843 two short lines were
made in Ireland and in England, one of considerable
length from London to Portsmouth for Government.</p>

<p>In 1867 he received the fourth Royal Albert
medal, his name being preceded by Faraday’s, for
the first introduction of a practical electric telegraph.</p>

<p>Her Majesty conferred on him the honor of
Knighthood, November 11, 1869, as a recognition
of his great and special services in connection
with the electric telegraph, and on July 25, 1871,
conferred on him a civil pension of £100.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39">39</a></span></p>

<h3><i>Sir Charles Wheatstone, F.R.S., D.C.L., LL.D.</i><br />
<span class="subhead">1802&ndash;1875</span></h3>

<p>Who, together with Sir W.&nbsp;F. Cooke, introduced
and carried out practical electric telegraphy, was
the son of Mr. Wheatstone, of Gloucester, at which
place he was born.</p>

<p>He was educated at a private school and brought
up to the business of making musical instruments,
which turned his attention to acoustics.</p>

<p>He published his first work in 1823, “New Experiments
in Sound,” and having studied Young’s
theory of light, the results of his investigations
were communicated to the Royal Society through
Faraday, in 1833.</p>

<p>In the following year he was appointed Professor
of Experimental Philosophy, at King’s College,
London.</p>

<p>He was made F.&nbsp;R.&nbsp;S. in 1836, and two years
later described the stereoscope, which he had invented,
in a paper which he read before the Society.</p>

<p>Mr. Cooke (later Sir W.&nbsp;F. Cooke), was introduced
to Professor Wheatstone, and they decided
to unite their efforts to introduce the use of the
telegraph on a large scale in England.</p>

<p>They took out their first patent for the electric
telegraph laid on the Blackwall Railway in 1837.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40">40</a></span>
Wheatstone received the Royal Medal in 1840,
the Copley Medal in 1843, was one of the Jurors at
the Paris Exhibition (1855), when he received the
decoration of the Legion of Honor, and was
knighted in 1868.</p>

<p>He was corresponding member of the principal
academies of science in Europe.</p>

<p>It was by his skill in turning knowledge to practical
account that Wheatstone gave the electric
telegraph the character which it now possesses.
Though his inventions in other branches of science
are as numerous as they are various, yet it is in
connection with the electric telegraph that the
name of Wheatstone will live.</p>

<p>He was the inventor of the telegraph, indeed.
No one else can lay claim to that title.</p>

<p>Stephen Gray, in 1827, suspended a wire, seven
hundred feet long, on silk threads, and on applying
an excited glass tube to one end, electrification was
observed at the other, but he did not send messages.
Advances were made from that time by many
men of science, who saw more or less clearly the
great possibilities before them.</p>

<p>Omitting the pioneer claims of Sommering, Lomond
and others of the last century, the names
connected with the early development of the practical
telegraph are Froment in France, Gauss,
Weber and Steinheil, in Germany, Sir Francis<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41">41</a></span>
Ronalds and Edward Davy, in England, Morse and
Vail, in America. But to Wheatstone and his co-adjutor
Sir William Fothergill Cooke is due the
merit of having been the first to render it available
for the public transmission of messages.</p>

<p>In 1834, shortly after being appointed Professor
of Experimental Physics at King’s College, London,
Wheatstone began experimenting on rate of transmission
electricity along wires. For this purpose
about half a mile of copper wire was insulated by
suspension in the vaults under the college, and
three interruptions of this circuit was made by
three parts of brass knobs with a small interval
between them, one of these interruptions was in the
middle point of the conductor and the other two
near the ends.</p>

<p>A leyden jar was discharged through the wire
and the interval of time between the occurrence of
the sparks at the ends and occurrence of the spark
at the middle was measured by noting the displacement
of the image of the middle spark in a mirror
revolving at a known speed. It was calculated
from results of this experiment that the velocity of
an electric disturbance along a wire was about two
hundred and fifty thousand miles per second, a
result differing from the true speed of one hundred
and eighty-six thousand miles per second; not very
widely, considering the difficulties of observation in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42">42</a></span>
an experiment of this kind. From this research he
passed on to the transmission of messages by electricity,
and in conjunction with Cooke he elaborated
the five needle telegraph, the first that came
into general use.</p>

<p>Wheatstone’s fertility of scientific resource led
the partners on to many new developments.</p>

<p>The letter showing dial telegraph in 1841 and
the magneto-electro dial telegraph, a subsequent
extension of the same to type embossing, and lastly
the automatic transmitting and receiving instruments
by which messages are sent with such
great rapidity.</p>

<p>He was the first to appreciate the importance
of reducing to a minimum the amount of work to
be done by the current at the receiving station by
diminishing as far as practicable the mass and
therefore the inertia of the moving parts.</p>

<p>This was beautifully exemplified in that marvel
of ingenuity, the magneto-electro letter showing
telegraph, which was particularly applicable for
private telegraph uses.</p>

<p>From 1837 Wheatstone appears to have devoted
a good deal of time to submarine telegraphy, and
in 1844 experiments were made in Swansea bay
with the assistance of Mr. J.&nbsp;D. Llewellyn.</p>

<p>Wheatstone also had a share in the perfecting
of the magneto-electric machines which have culminated
in the modern dynamo.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43">43</a></span>
In 1837 he devised a method of combining several
armatures on one shaft so as to generate currents
which were continuous instead of intermittent,
and in 1867 he described to the Royal Society
a method of making such machines self-exciting as
to their magnetism by the use of a shunt circuit.</p>

<p>The use of a main circuit for the purpose had
been described by Werner Siemens one month
earlier, but the machine described by Wheatstone
had been constructed for him by Mr. Stroh in the
preceding summer.</p>

<p>Wheatstone was also the inventor of electro-magnetic
clocks for indicating time at any number
of different places united on a circuit.</p>

<p>It was he who called attention to Christy’s combination
of wires, now commonly known as Wheatstone’s
bridge&mdash;in which an electric balancing of the
currents is obtained and worked out in its applications
to electrical measurements.</p>

<p>He was one of the first in Great Britain to appreciate
the importance of ohms simple law of
the relation between electro-motive force resistance
of conductors and resulting current&mdash;the law which
is to-day the foundation of all electrical engineering.</p>

<p>Wheatstone contributed to numerous scientific
journals and publications.</p>

<p>All his published papers were collected in 1879
by the Physical Society of London.</p>

<div class="chapter" id="two">
<h2><a id="The_Telegraph_in_America"></a><i>The Telegraph in America</i></h2>
</div>

<p>Mr. Morse, the inventor of the telegraph system
which bears his name, first conceived the idea on
board the packet ship “Sully” on which he was a
passenger. He sailed from Havre for New York
on the first day of October, 1832. He was accompanied
by a number of others, the whole company
being unusually intelligent and agreeable. There
was a long voyage before them, and each amiably
undertook to relieve the tedium of the journey
by the many pleasant devices indulged in by companionable
travellers.</p>

<p>At an early period of the voyage, the conversation
around the evening table turned upon the subject
of electricity and magnetism which was then
a popular topic of discussion and general interest.</p>

<p>One of the passengers (a Doctor Jackson) introduced
the subject by reference to lectures to
which he had recently attended while in Paris, in
which interesting illustrations of the more recent
discoveries in electro-magnetism had been given.</p>

<p>He also referred to the experiments of Ampère
with the electro magnet; the subject excited very
general interest into which Morse entered with
great spirit. Hitherto he had felt no other concern
in electrical matters than that of a lively and
attentive curiosity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45">45</a></span>
Dr. Jackson had in his trunk an electro-magnet,
which he described, and during the conversation
alluded to the length of the wire in the coils. This
led one of the company to enquire “if the velocity
of the current was retarded by the length of the
wire?”</p>

<p>Dr. Jackson replied that electricity passed instantaneously
over any known length of wire. This
aroused the interest of Morse who was struck with
the idea that electricity might be made the medium
of conveying intelligence.</p>

<p>The conversation went on but he left them. As
he paced the deck the idea rapidly took form in his
mind that, either by electro-chemical or electro-magnetic
effects of a current, marks might be
made at distances so great and in such variety as
to render possible the easy communication of and
record of an intelligible language.</p>

<p>This was, so far as he knew at the time, a new
thought. Gradually the conception took shape and
system until at last it had assumed such a form
that next morning, at the breakfast table, he communicated
the plan by which he believed a recording
telegraph could be serviceable.</p>

<p>Later on as the voyage was nearing its end, Mr.
Morse, addressing the Captain, said “Well, Captain,
should you hear of the telegraph one of these<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46">46</a></span>
days as the wonder of the world, remember the discovery
was made on board the good ship “Sully.”</p>

<p>He would now have devoted himself entirely to
the elaboration of this new thought, but he had to
betake himself to his work as an artist. He was
poor and for three or four years following his return
he had to travel much of the time to meet
engagements in connection with his profession.
Meanwhile, he devoted every spare moment to the
perfecting of his apparatus.</p>

<p>In a letter to a friend Mr. Morse wrote: “Up to
the autumn of 1837, my telegraphic apparatus
existed in so crude a form that I felt reluctant to
have it seen. My means were very limited&mdash;so
limited as to preclude the possibility of constructing
an apparatus of such mechanical finish as to warrant
my success in venturing upon its public exhibition.
I had no wish to expose to ridicule the representative
of so many hours of laborious
thought. Prior to the summer of 1837, at which
time Mr. Alfred Vail’s attention became attracted
to my telegraph, I depended upon my pencil for
my subsistence. Indeed, so straightened were my
circumstances, that in order to save time to carry
out my invention, and to economize my scanty
means, I had for months lodged and eaten in my
studio, procuring my food in small quantities from
some grocery, and preparing it myself to conceal<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47">47</a></span>
from my friends the stinted manner in which I
lived. I was in the habit of bringing my food to
my room in the evenings, and this was my mode
of life for many years.”</p>

<p>Under these distressing circumstances, Mr.
Morse labored in perfecting his apparatus in which
he finally succeeded. His caveat was filed in the
patent office in Washington on October 6, 1837,
but a patent was not obtained until 1840.</p>

<p>On the 8th of February, 1838, in response to an
invitation from the Franklin Institute of Philadelphia,
Prof. Morse exhibited the new telegraph before
the Committee of Science and Arts of that
institution, who reported their gratification and
expressed their desire that government would give
the means of testing it on an extensive scale.</p>

<p>Mr. Morse, shortly after this, exhibited his apparatus
before the President and his cabinet, and
which gave great satisfaction, in reference to
which he wrote his friend and partner Mr. Alfred
Vail, as follows: “Everything looks encouraging,
but I need not say to you that in this world a continued
course of prosperity is not a rational expectation.
We shall doubtless find troubles and difficulties
in store for us, and it is part of true wisdom
to be prepared for whatever may await us. If
our hearts are right, we shall not be taken by surprise.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48">48</a></span>
I see nothing now but an unclouded prospect,
for which let us pay to Him who shows it to
us, the homage of grateful and obedient hearts,
with most earnest prayers for grace to use prosperity
aright.”</p>

<p>Morse now determined to ask Congress for aid
to make a thorough test of his apparatus on an
actual line to show its capacity and practicability;
in this he was encouraged by his friends. On December
6, 1842, he wrote an exhaustive letter to
the Hon. C.&nbsp;G. Ferris, an influential member of the
House Committee on Commerce, in which he gave
a minute history of the invention, stated fully the
basis of his claims as the inventor, and asked that
through his committee an appeal might be made to
Congress for the means to erect an experimental
line to prove its value. In response to this the
Hon. John P. Kennedy, February 23, 1843, offered
a resolution “That the Bill appropriating
thirty thousand dollars to be expended under the
direction of the Secretary of the Treasury, in a
series of experiments to test the expediency of the
telegraph projected by Professor Morse should
be passed.”</p>

<p>Mr. Morse sat in the gallery during the discussion
which followed, a quiet but intensively anxious
observer. For a time the project was made the
subject of ridicule.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49">49</a></span>
Irritated perhaps because the committee passed
him in the control of the experiment, the Postmaster
proposed to give half the sum appropriated
by the bill to mesmeric experiments.</p>

<p>Another proposed that millerism have a share.
The bill seemed doomed to failure by their ridicule.
The debate became sharp and vigorous when, at
length, the vote was taken with the result that the
Bill passed by a majority of eight.</p>

<p>The bill, however, had yet to pass the Senate,
and its temper respecting it was unknown. It had
much unfinished business. Day after day passed,
but the bill had not been reached. Finally the last
hours of the session arrived.</p>

<p>Morse watched them as they passed with an
anxious solicitude. It was getting late, ten o’clock
had already struck, two hours only remained before
the final adjournment. Just then the Hon. Fernando
Wood, one of the Senators, came to Mr.
Morse and advised him to go home. “The Senate
is not in sympathy with your project. I advise you
to give it up. Return home and think no more of
it.” Morse, feeling it useless to remain longer,
with a heavy heart went to his hotel, paid his
bill, procured a ticket for New York and retired to
his room for the night. He there knelt down,
opened his heart to God and committed his affairs<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50">50</a></span>
to Him. He had done all that he could and could
do more.</p>

<p>He counted his money and found after paying his
bill and ticket he had thirty-seven and a half cents
left.</p>

<p>In the morning, refreshed by rest yet grave and
thoughtful, he came down to breakfast. While
seated at the table a visitor was announced. The
early visitant proved to be a young lady friend,
Miss Ellsworth, the daughter of the Commissioner
of Patents, who taking him warmly by the hand,
exclaimed with a voice of unconcealed joy, “Professor,
I have come on purpose to congratulate you.”
“Congratulate me! For what, my dear friend, can
you offer me congratulations?” “Why,” she said
gaily (as she enjoyed the Professor’s wondering
surprise, and who was at the time not in the fittest
mood for pleasantry), “on the passage of your bill.
The Senate, last night, voted you your money,
$30,000.”</p>

<p>She then informed him that her father remained
in the Senate until the close of the session, and
that in the very closing moments the telegraph
bill was passed without division or debate. On
reaching home, Ellsworth had communicated the
news to his family, all of whom were much attached
to the Professor, and his daughter begged the favor<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51">51</a></span>
of being allowed to go to the hotel to communicate
the good news.</p>

<p>It was the desire of a good warm-hearted woman.
So she had hastened on her pleasant errand, and
now, having told her story, she asked, “Am I really
the first to communicate this to you?”</p>

<p>The tidings were so unexpected that for some moments
he could make no reply. At length he said,
“Yes, Annie, you are the first to inform me. I was
until now utterly unconscious of the fact, and now I
am going to make you a promise. When the line
is completed, the first despatch sent upon it from
Washington to Baltimore shall be yours.” “Well,”
she replied, “I will hold you to your promise.”</p>

<p>All details having been arranged between the
Government and Mr. Morse, the construction of
the line was proceeded with. He was allowed a
salary of $2,500 per annum during the test. Mr.
Alfred Vail took charge of the machinery while Mr.
Ezra Cornell was made Superintendent of construction.</p>

<p>It was most unfortunate for Mr. Morse that his
mind from the very first seemed prepossessed in
favor of underground lines which had been adopted
in England. They gave to him the general impression
of safety and permanence, and he selected the
plan without experiment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52">52</a></span>
He had ordered to be made in New York forty
miles of a five wire cable enclosed in lead, and Mr.
Cornell invented a plow to make the trench for its
reception.</p>

<p>This cable was laid from Baltimore to the Relay
House, seven miles away, but on testing it the
escape was found so great that the necessity of
abandoning it became evident. More than half the
appropriation had been expended. After much
anxious thought, it was decided to place the wires
on poles, and the line was finished in this way with
two copper wires of size number 14, covered with
cotton saturated with gum shellac.</p>

<p>The first insulation of the government line shows
how crude and rudimentary was the conception
held at that period. It was simply two plates of
glass, between which the wire, after wrapping well
with cloth saturated with gum shellac, was placed
and over which a wooden cover to protect from
rain and press the glass upon the wire and keep it
in place was nailed.</p>

<p>These were afterwards removed and the Bureau
Knob pattern substituted.</p>

<p>In about one year after the appropriation had
been made, the line was completed.</p>

<p>The first telegraph office in Washington was in a
small room on the east front of the Capitol, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53">53</a></span>
afterwards in a room over the city post-office. The
relays were of number 16 cotton covered copper
wire saturated in gum shellac, each weighing about
510 pounds, and so coarsely constructed that Mr.
Vail kept the ones in use in a back room where the
operator had to run when it needed adjustment.</p>

<p>The battery consisted of 100 cells of Grove, which
was renewed three times a week. The circuits were
left open when the line was not in use, and the instruments
were so connected that each operator
started and stopped the instrument at the distant
station by the dropping of a break upon the fly
wheel when the manipulations of the keys were
suspended.</p>

<p>The magnets were soon after greatly improved,
reduced in size, and increased in power.</p>

<p>True to the promise he had made to his friend,
Miss Ellsworth, Prof. Morse now sent for her and
to which she at once responded.</p>

<p>She was invited to indicate a message for transmission.
It was promptly done in language now
historic and in consonance with the inventor’s own
often expressed thoughts respecting the origin of
his invention, indeed, he may have suggested the
words “What hath God wrought.” This message
was passed over the wires, and the strip of paper on
which it was imprinted was given to Governor Seymour<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54">54</a></span>
of Connecticut, as a souvenir in honor of the
young woman who was a native of his State, and of
the inventor who received therein his collegiate
training.</p>

<p>An incident now brought the usefulness of the
telegraph into public recognition.</p>

<p>The National Convention to nominate a President
was in session at Baltimore. James K. Polk
had been nominated President, and Silas Wright,
then in the Senate, and in Washington at the time,
as Vice-President. This was communicated over
the wires. In a few minutes the convention was
astonished to receive a message from Mr. Wright
respectfully declining the nomination. The presiding
officer read the despatch, but the convention
could not or would not believe its authenticity, and
adjourned to await the report of a committee sent
to Washington to confer with that gentleman. The
committee confirmed the telegraphic message.
This fact soon became known when the fame of the
telegraph at once took wing.</p>

<p>It is related that about this time that a prominent
functionary asked an assistant “how large a
bundle could be sent over the wires, and if the
United States mails could not be sent in the same
way!”</p>

<p>Some wag did straddle a pair of dirty boots over
the wires and very seriously told an astonished<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55">55</a></span>
citizen that they got dirty by coming so rapidly
from Baltimore!</p>

<p>On the opening of the government line, Mr. O.
E. Wood, at that time connected with the engineering
department of the State of New York, was induced
by his brother-in-law, Ezra Cornell, to give
up his profession and join Mr. Morse at Washington.
He then became Mr. Morse’s first pupil.</p>

<p>In November, 1844, he received over the wires
from Baltimore the result of the Presidential elections
in Northern and Eastern States, and with Mr.
Vail spent the winter of 1844&ndash;45 in exhibiting
the working of the telegraph to members of Congress,
diplomatic representatives and to visitors attracted
thither from all parts of the globe. He
also transmitted to the Baltimore press a report of
the proceedings of Congress for publication.</p>

<p>On April 1, 1845, the line, which had been
worked as a curiosity, was thrown open for public
business.</p>

<p>The operators appointed were Mr. Vail at Washington
and Mr. Henry J. Rogers at Baltimore.</p>

<p>During the first four days the receipts amounted
to one cent. This was obtained from an office
seeker who said he had nothing less than a twenty
dollar bill and one cent, and with the modesty of
his class, wanted to witness the operations of the
telegraph free, this was refused because against<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56">56</a></span>
orders. He was told he could have a cent’s worth
of telegraphy, to which he agreed, and he was
gratified in the following manner:</p>

<p>Washington asked Baltimore “4” which meant
in the list of signals “what time is it?” Baltimore
replied “1,” which meant “one o’clock.” This was
one character each way which would amount to half
a cent. The man paid his one cent, magnanimously
declined the change, and went his way satisfied.</p>

<p>This was the total revenue of four days.</p>

<p>On the 5th, twelve and a half cents; the sixth
was the Sabbath; on the seventh the receipts ran up
to sixty cents; on the eighth, to a dollar and thirty-two
cents, and on the ninth, to a dollar and four
cents. Not a very dazzling prospect certainly, yet
watchful eyes saw its future value.</p>

<p>It is recorded that about this time a certain good
dame, whose ideas of discipline were somewhat
stern and fundamental, after surveying a pole recently
planted near her door, placing her hands on
her haunches, and looking critically at the pole, exclaimed,
“Now I s’pose no one can spank their
brats without bein’ known to the hull cree-a-tion!”</p>

<p>The telegraph was fairly under weigh. Prof.
Morse offered to sell his rights to the Government
for one hundred thousand dollars, but the Postmaster
General was not satisfied. The operations of
the telegraph between Washington and Baltimore<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57">57</a></span>
had not shown him that, under any rate of postage
that could be devised, its revenue could be made
equal to its expenditure. The offer was therefore
declined. This refusal was fortunate both for the
inventor and the country.</p>

<p>The next move was to enlist private capital, and
this was soon accomplished.</p>

<p>The first telegraph company in the United States,
the “Magnetic Telegraph Company,” was formed,
but this was not attained without difficulty.</p>

<p>Early in 1845 Mr. Kendall, formerly Postmaster
General in President Jackson’s administration, was
induced, after much deliberation and consultation,
to take a leading part in organizing the Company.</p>

<p>It was thought expedient to make the first attempt
to construct a line between New York and
Philadelphia, and to limit the capital to the probable
cost of that section, the traffic between these large
cities being extensive, and likely to prove remunerative.</p>

<p>To aid in securing capital. Mr. Ezra Cornell and
Mr. O.&nbsp;S. Wood went to New York to exhibit the
telegraphic apparatus upon a short experimental
line strung on the tops of buildings.</p>

<p>Offices were opened, one at 112 Broadway, and
the other in a building near where the Metropolitan
Hotel now stands. Permission to allow the connecting
wires to be erected on the tops of houses<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58">58</a></span>
was obtained with much trouble, and only after
paying Prof. Silliman, Jr., a fee of fifty dollars for
an expert opinion respecting its safety before the
property owners would consent to the wires being
erected.</p>

<p>The price of admission to witness the operation
of the telegraph was twenty-five cents. This seemed
a novel way to secure capital in a great city like New
York.</p>

<p>With this embargo, notwithstanding the wonderful
character of the invention, there was not visitors
enough to pay expenses; everything indicated
poverty. The exhibitors were so poor that one of
them was glad to use a couple of common chairs
for his nightly rest.</p>

<p>It was certainly a strange experience for the
future princely founder of Cornell University,
making his breakfast out of the proceeds of a shilling
picked up, as it were, from the sidewalks of
Broadway, and which, he said, were the best meals
he had ever enjoyed.</p>

<p>The estimated cost of a line from Fort Lee on
the Hudson to Philadelphia was $15,000&mdash;a modest
sum to ask of the great city of New York, but the
men of capital looked over their immaculate collars
at the ticking machinery, and into the faces of
the hungry exhibitors, and up at the wire straggling
among the chimney pots, and then down at
the meagre furniture, and said “No;” each man<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59">59</a></span>
feared to be the first fool. But what capitalists
would not do, humbler men did.</p>

<p>One of the first men in New York to invest his
money in the new device was the keeper of an
eating-house on Nassau Street, and who afterward
became one of the directors.</p>

<p>The money needed was finally raised, but chiefly
outside of New York. It was provided in this
original subscription that the payment of fifty
dollars should entitle the subscribers to two shares
of fifty dollars each.</p>

<p>A payment of fifteen thousand dollars, therefore,
required an issue of $30,000 stock. To the patentees
was issued an additional $30,000 stock, or
half of the capital, as a consideration of the patent;
the capital was, therefore, $60,000 for the first link.</p>

<p>Trustees were appointed to hold the patent
rights and property until the organization was
effected.</p>

<h3>“THE MAGNETIC TELEGRAPH COMPANY.”</h3>

<p>Early in November, 1845, the line was first
opened between Philadelphia and Norristown, Pa.
distant 14 miles, so as to gratify public curiosity,
while the building was going on beyond. This was
completed to Fort Lee on January 20, 1846, and
from Baltimore to Philadelphia, June 5, the same
year.</p>

<p>No attempt was made for a long time to cross the
Hudson.</p>

<p>In April, 1850, two gutta percha covered wires
were submerged at Fort Lee, which for a time did
good service. Shortly after the formation of the
Magnetic Telegraph Company (the Pioneer Telegraph
Company in America), numerous organizations
followed. In 1859, the company amalgamated
with the American Telegraph Company.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61">61</a></span></p>

<h3>THE WESTERN UNION TELEGRAPH COMPANY AND ITS ORIGIN.</h3>

<p>In April, 1854, a combination was agreed upon
between the Erie and Michigan Telegraph Company
and the New York and Mississippi Valley Printing
Telegraph Company. The united capital being
$500,000 under the name of the Western Union
Telegraph Company, by an act of the legislature of
Wisconsin, dated March 4, 1856, and of the State
of New York, of April 4, 1856.</p>

<p>The following year the Michigan Southern Telegraph
Company was added to this combination.</p>

<p>The headquarters of the Company were at
Rochester, N.Y. Other companies joined the
united companies and the Western Union found
it necessary to transfer its headquarters to New
York, but the most notable of these consolidations
took place in 1866, when the United States Telegraph
Company, as well as the American Telegraph
Company, joined forces with the Western Union,
thus virtually embracing the entire telegraph business
of the country.</p>

<p>In this year the capital was readjusted and
appointed to the various interests forming the
Western Union combination.</p>

<p>Soon after the union of the many conflicting<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62">62</a></span>
telegraph interests had been effected, and through
fear of a burdensome monopoly, a move was made
towards the nationalization of the telegraphs. As a
matter of course, this was strenuously opposed by
the telegraph company’s representatives, and public
sentiment was with the company.</p>

<p>Although politicians as a rule were favourably
inclined to such a step, the majority of the people
were against it, or indifferent, with the result that
the movement dropped out of view, and has so far
as known never been revived up to this period.</p>

<p>In telegraph operations little attention had been
given to electricity as a science in America. Any
improvements which had been made in connection
with telegraphic appliances, except in repeating appliances,
were of a comparatively trifling and unscientific
character.</p>

<p>Marshall Lefferts had done much to show the
value of statistics, and had laid down important
ground work for systematized and scientific methods;
he had even introduced some of the electric tests
by which the telegraph wires afterward became so
potential, but no clearly defined system had been in
practice.</p>

<p>The battery man still multiplied his cells, emptied
his carboys of nitric or sulphuric acid, and bathed
his zincs in mercury, to raise the telegraphic steam;
the patient operator turned and returned during the
long hours of the weary nights the spring of his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63">63</a></span>
relay, to catch the erratic movements of the armature
as it vibrated before the changing currents on the
line.</p>

<p>Cromwell Varley, a well-known electrician whose
accomplishments as a gentleman of education as well
as a scientist had preceded him in the frequent
appearance of his name in the records of scientific
investigation, had arrived in New York. Mr. Orton,
at this time the President of the Western Union
Company, invited Mr. Varley to make a thorough
investigation into the condition of the lines and
apparatus owned by the Company.</p>

<p>The report made by Mr. Varley, minute and exhaustive,
revealed a startling condition of things&mdash;half
of the wires were found to be practically unavailable.</p>

<p>The best wires in the service showed a resistance
far above the proper standard.</p>

<p>A popular relay was found to have a resistance
equal to one hundred miles of number 8 wire, the
use of which was choking the most important
circuits.</p>

<p>The chief value of Mr. Varley’s report, indeed
was in giving a practical illustration of the immense
value of a scientific electrical training.</p>

<p>The electrician now came to be an important
factor in American telegraphic work.</p>

<p>To this report also may be fairly traced the
beginning of a series of improvements and inventions
which have made famous the American name.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64">64</a></span>
By removing the obstructions to the electric
current and reducing resistances in wires, magnets
and batteries to a minimum, the great possibilities of
the wires were discovered in accomplishments which
were never dreamed of.</p>

<p>The duplex and quadruplex are great advances
on the old condition, and would have been inoperative
had they continued.</p>

<p>The visit of Mr. Varley had another result&mdash;the
consolidation of so many important organizations
under a single administration had unavoidably
brought together more or less discordant elements;
each company had its own peculiar methods, ideas
of management, limitations of authority, rules of
order, etc., as well as of tariffs and compensation.
It was of the utmost importance that, in order to
unity of management, distinct and clearly defined
ideas of duty should be made to permeate the
entire working force so as to make conflict impossible,
and work quick, certain, harmonious.</p>

<p>It was scarcely less desirable also, now that the
value of electric knowledge had been demonstrated,
that by some means its attainment might be
rendered easy and general, and a stimulus given to
its acquisition. Under these circumstances Mr. Orton
established the journal of the telegraph, and its usefulness
soon became apparent; its clippings from the
scientific journals of European and Home papers on
electric art soon came to be the theme of almost
universal interest.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65">65</a></span>
A copy of this paper was mailed to every office
of the Company as soon as issued. It became not
only the vehicle for executive orders for the announcement
of new offices and of changes in the
tariff, but imperceptibly, yet markedly, the means of
infusing an “esprit de corps” and sense of brotherhood
throughout the telegraph service.</p>

<p>At the solicitation of Mr. Orton, Mr. James D.
Reid accepted the management of the journal of the
telegraph, by whom it was admirably conducted for
a number of years, with the praiseworthy results
previously noted.</p>

<p>In view of the recent boundary arbitration between
the United States and Great Britain, it may be
interesting to recall the circumstances which led the
American Government to become interested in
Alaska as a connecting link in a telegraph project, to
connect Europe and America by land wires.</p>

<p>When, in 1858, the Atlantic Cable proved a failure,
and was looked upon as an utter impossibility, a
Mr. Collins, the American commercial agent resident
at St. Petersburg, proposed to construct a
line of telegraph overland from the United States
(via) Behring Strait and Asiatic Russia to Europe.</p>

<p>Perceiving the importance of the project, Mr. J.
Cochrane, a member of Congress and of the Committee
on Commerce, reported to that body on Feb.
18, 1861, a bill appropriating $50,000 for “The
Survey of the Northern Waters, Coasts and Islands<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66">66</a></span>
of the Pacific Ocean and Behring Strait, having
reference to telegraphic connection with Russia,”
and expressing full faith in its possibility.</p>

<p>In the United States Senate, Feb. 17, 1862, Mr.
Latham also made an elaborate report, revealing the
vast progress of telegraphs in Europe and the
enthusiastic and enlightened action of the Russian
Government in the proposed extension of her telegraph
system to the Pacific.</p>

<p>A line had already been mapped out from Kazan,
through Circassia.</p>

<p>From Omsk a line was traced out with the design
of reaching India through the Northern Central
gate of Asia. Still another was projected from the
Amoor line to Pekin, Shanghai, Amoy and Hong
Kong&mdash;thus, to reach the trade of China, these projects
showed the value of the telegraph to commerce.</p>

<p>Mr. Latham asked an appropriation of $100,000
for a survey of the route from California to the
Amoor.</p>

<p>Russia offered her aid and a rebate of forty per
cent. on American messages when communication
was established.</p>

<p>Russia had already assured the construction of the
line 7,000 miles from Moscow to the Pacific.</p>

<p>Secretary Seward took a deep interest in the
enterprise, in a report to the Senate, May 4, 1864.</p>

<p>On the proposition of Mr. Collins, he said: “I
think it may be regarded as settled that the United<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67">67</a></span>
States cannot neglect to employ telegraphic communication
with foreign countries, and yet expect to
maintain a healthful commerce with them; that the
United States cannot hope to inspire respect, confidence
and good will abroad, and to secure peace
with foreign States, without using the magnetic
telegraph when it is possible. I do not know any
one object lying within the scope of our foreign
relations more directly important than the preservation
of peace and friendship with Great Britain and
Russia; nor can I conceive of any measure of
nationality that would more effectually tend to
secure that great object than the construction of
this proposed international telegraph.”</p>

<p>The sentiments thus officially expressed by Mr.
Seward were responded to by all intelligent men,
and the Russian line was the most popular of the
enterprises of the period.</p>

<p>The proposition to construct the Russian American
line was first formally submitted by Mr. Collins
to the Western Union Telegraph Company, Sept.
28, 1863, and again at a meeting of the board of
that company in Rochester, N.Y., March 16, 1864.</p>

<p>It was in the form of a letter from Mr. Collins,
requesting the acceptance of his project to connect
Europe and America by way of the Behring Strait,
and offering, if accepted within twenty days, to
transfer his rights and privileges under certain conditions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68">68</a></span>
The terms offered by him were accepted by the
board of directors.</p>

<p>Soon after this construction commenced, beginning
at New Westminster, B.C., the terminus of the
California State Telegraph Company. The line in
a few months was carried to the Skeena river.
Meanwhile Mr. Serge Abasa, a Russian gentleman
who had entered the service of the Western Union
Company, was despatched to the Asiatic coast
between the mouth of the Amoor and Behring
Strait.</p>

<p>Mr. Abasa reported, January 18, 1866:&mdash;“Inform
the directors, the entire extent between Anadyr and
Okhotsk district has been surveyed, but the route of
the line has been determined by me in person, and
notwithstanding the scarcity of laborers in the
country, I have commenced preparatory works in
Anudirsk, Jijiginsk, Yamsk, Taousk and Okhotsk.”</p>

<p>In the midst of all this enthusiasm, however, the
Great Eastern, at the docks of an English harbor
was having a cable coiled in her immense hold for
another attempt to lay a submarine line between
Europe and America.</p>

<p>When it was announced that at last victory had
come, and that the continents were speaking to each
other with easy garrulity, the overland line was
abandoned.</p>

<p>It was a question of two thousand miles of cable
against sixteen thousand miles of land line, half of
which was along an uninhabited coast. The advantage<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69">69</a></span>
of the cable was too palpable; orders were,
therefore, issued recalling the men.</p>

<p>Already some eight hundred and fifty miles of
line had been built, and was in operation between
New Westminster, B.C., and the Skeena River.</p>

<p>The United States Government were duly notified
of the stoppage of the work by the Western Union
Telegraph Company, to which the Secretary of State
wrote the following <span class="locked">reply:&mdash;</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>I am not one of those who have been disappointed
by the complete and magnificent success
of the International Atlantic Telegraph.</p>

<p>I regard it as tributary to an expansion of our
national commerce, and ultimately to our political
institutions, both of which are important forces in
the progress of civilization.</p>

<p>I would not have the Atlantic become dumb
again if thereby I could immediately secure the success
of the Inter-Continental Pacific enterprise which
was committed into your hands. Nevertheless, I
confess to a profound disappointment in the suspension
of the latter enterprise.</p>

<p>I admit that the reasons you have assigned for
the suspension seem to be irresistible. On the
other hand, I abate no jot of my former estimate of
the importance of the Inter-Continental Pacific Telegraph.</p>

<p>I do not believe that the United States and Russia
have given their faith to each other and to the
world for the prosecution of that great enterprise in
vain.</p>

<p class="sigright">
<span class="smcap">W. H. Seward.</span>
</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70">70</a></span>
The loss was very great to the enterprising company
who had undertaken the responsibility, but
everything was paid up without a murmur. The
sum expended amounted to $3,170,292.</p>

<p>That the Western Union was enabled to defray
this enormous expenditure without in any way impairing
its stock value or credit proved the solidity
of the Company even at that period of its history.</p>

<p>The friendly intercourse between the American
and Russian authorities in connection with their
telegraph project was, no doubt, the direct cause of
the subsequent negotiations between the two Governments
for the sale and purchase of Alaska, the advantages
of which the astute Secretary of State, Mr.
Seward, became cognizant, and finally consummated
the transfer of that territory from Russia to the great
Republic.</p>

<p>In the early days of telegraph enterprise the necessity
soon became evident that, in order to provide the
requisite facilities for public convenience and for the
economical employment of capital, the consolidation
of the many struggling companies was self-evident.
This policy has been carried out effectually by the
Western Union Telegraph Company, which gradually
absorbed by lease or purchase upwards of fifty concerns
from the date of its organization at Rochester,
N.Y., to the removal of its offices to New York. In
1866 this Company had virtually absorbed all rival
and opposing companies of any importance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71">71</a></span>
The commanding position reached by the Western
Union in 1866, with its growing ramifications covered
by 75,000 miles of wire, has steadily advanced until
the present. It embraces in its great system over
1,000,000 miles of wire, over 23,500 separate offices,
two atlantic cables, a cable to Cuba with connections
throughout the West Indies, and close direct connections
with all parts of South America. In Canada
the Great Northwestern Telegraph Company, which
leased the Montreal and Dominion Telegraph Companies,
is controlled by the Western Union Telegraph
Company. So also is the Nova Scotia and New
Brunswick Telegraph Companies.</p>

<p>In 1872, six years after its reorganization, the
Western Union owned in</p>

<h3>THE POSTAL TELEGRAPH CABLE COMPANY.</h3>

<p>This Company was organized in 1881. Its original
promoters expected by the use of compound steel
and copper wire of large size and the use of the Leggo-automatic
and Gray-harmonic apparatus to transmit
a large volume of business by the use of so few
wires and at such a speed that a uniform and low
rate would produce a revenue sufficient to justify a
capitalization largely in excess of the cost of the
plant.</p>

<p>The name postal was chosen upon the theory that
the new plan of construction and method of transmission
would bring the property into extensive use
in competition with or perhaps as an auxiliary of
the Post-Office department.</p>

<p>How far the purpose of the founders was speculative
need not now be considered. Probably some
of them were sincere in their beliefs, but they were
ignorant of the telegraph business, and the fallacy of
their plan was soon demonstrated.</p>

<p>In order to help a friend, who had become largely
involved in the bonds of the Company, Mr. John W.
Mackay found himself in control of the property in
1884. He had in the meantime been induced to interest
himself in the organization of a new cable service<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75">75</a></span>
between Great Britain, France and the United
States, of which, through the failure of some of those
who were to join in the enterprise, he also came into
control. Having “put his hand to the plow,” so to
speak, although the business was wholly new to him,
he was not the man to turn back, and the more he
examined the merit of the business itself, the better
satisfied he became that, if it could be properly conducted
in its details and the complicated and chaotic
condition of the numerous comparatively small, but
ruinously competing land line companies could be
brought into right form and order, a successful and in
every way creditable business worthy of the employment
of his ample resources could be built up.</p>

<p>When the Western Union Company, early in 1881,
under the leadership of Mr. Jay Gould, acquired control
of the Atlantic &amp; Pacific, the American Union
and the combined Canadian telegraphs, and formed
an alliance with the cable companies, it then seemed
as if competition in the telegraph business had come
to an end, and many of its ablest men were of that
opinion, but by the end of 1884 more extensive and
more injurious competition had been built up in the
United States than had ever existed before, and the
possibility of bringing order out of such chaos seemed
remote, but Mr. Mackay was not discouraged.</p>

<p>Early in 1884 he secured the services of Mr. George
G. Ward, who had been brought up in the business of
the telegraph in England, and had been in the service<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76">76</a></span>
of the cable companies almost from their inception,
and was Superintendent of the Direct United
States Cable Company from 1875 to 1883. Under
his direction the first of the Commercial Cable Company’s
cables was completed in December, 1884.</p>

<p>Early in that month Mr. Albert B. Chandler entered
Mr. Mackay’s personal service, having been
assured of his purpose to permanently establish a
telegraph system upon sound and just principles respecting
which they were in full accord.</p>

<p>Mr. Chandler had served in almost every capacity
known to the telegraph business, from operator
in 1858 to President in 1879, and had won the confidence
of proprietors of telegraph property, of their
officials and employees, and the public as a practical,
energetic and conservative manager. Under his
guidance as receiver, the mortgage which had been
placed upon the property of the Postal Telegraph
Company under complete misapprehension of its
earning power, was foreclosed.</p>

<p>The Postal Telegraph Cable Company, of which he
became President and General Manager early in
1886, was organized. Extremely complicated and
vexatious litigation, chiefly a legacy from the
smaller companies, was gradually removed, and when,
near the close of 1887, the various fragmentary companies
had been acquired by either the Western
Union or the Postal Companies, competition, based
upon the cutting of rates, rebates and other wasteful<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77">77</a></span>
practices which could only end in destruction, was
promptly terminated by the competing companies.</p>

<p>Since then the telegraph business has been carried
on in the United States in a more business-like
and progressive manner than ever before.</p>

<p>There is so little friction between the two companies
apparent to the public, that it is sometimes
charged, or at least suspected, they are in actual
alliance, but such is not the case. Competition for
patronage was never so sharp as now, but it is based
upon excellence of facilities and service and treatment
of patrons, and not upon any form of buying
patronage with money, which has proven the ruin of
so many companies whose chief purpose seemed to
be to do the most harm in the shortest time, in order
to sell or lease their property for more than it was
fairly worth.</p>

<p>Probably no two men ever had more complete
control of large interests not their own during their
formative period than has been the case of Mr.
Chandler and Mr. Ward in their respective positions,
and to Mr. Mackay’s implicit confidence in them
may be attributed much of the success that has been
attained by the Commercial Cable and Postal Telegraph
Companies, which are now practically one
property.</p>

<p>Most of the principal officers of these companies
have been brought to their present positions by these<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78">78</a></span>
gentlemen, and the business is conducted with
singular harmony and efficiency.</p>

<p>Mr. Mackay, who was from its inception President
of the Commercial Cable Company, assumed also
the Presidency of the Postal Company early in 1901
at the earnest request of Mr. Chandler, who desired
to be relieved, partly by reason of somewhat
impaired health, and partly because of his preference
to spend much of his time in his Vermont
home. Upon his retirement from active charge, he
was made Chairman of the Board of Directors, and
in this capacity renders a variety of services and
exercises as a useful influence. He is still, as he has
been for many years, a Vice-President of the Commercial
Cable Company, of which Mr. Ward continues
as first Vice-President and General Manager.</p>

<p>Mr. Clarence H. Mackay has succeeded his father
as President of the Commercial Cable and Postal
Telegraph Companies, and entered with great pride
and energy into the project of laying a cable to
Hawaii and the Philippine Islands as projected by
his father.</p>

<p>These very important links in the circuit round
the globe adds further power and opportunity to the
Postal Company, whose activity seems now to have
fairly begun, and being laid upon sound foundations
of finance, construction and methods of business is
evidently destined to continue an increasing success.</p>

which also owns the Postal Telegraph and

amount of common shares, so that each stockholder

President of the Old Colony Trust Company of Boston,
both directors of the Commercial Cable Company,

<p>The plan is practically consummated.</p>

<p>Mr. Mackay said in reply to an enquiry that this
action on his part was the outcome of his desire to put
on a permanent basis the properties created by his
father, and to provide for all contingencies that might
arise from death or changes in commercial conditions.
He will continue to devote his entire time to the
active management of the Company.</p>

<p>The Commercial Cable Company owns and
operates four transatlantic cable lines and its connecting
lines between Nova Scotia and New York,

<h3>THE ASSOCIATED PRESS OF AMERICA.<br />
<span class="subhead">(<cite>London Daily Express.</cite>)</span></h3>

<p>With the evolution of the United States into a
world power there has grown up across the Atlantic
the greatest news-gathering agency ever imagined or
created, whose despatches are momentarily being
read by nearly half a hundred million people, and
upon which Europe itself is sometimes dependent
for the first word or whisper of what has happened
within her own gates. The name of the agency which
supplies America with its news is the Associated
Press.</p>

<p>Startling in its scope, romantic in its history, the
Associated Press has now, probably, more influence
upon daily international events than any other agent,
except the will of the peoples, which it helps to form.</p>

<p>Sixty years ago, when America was in industrial
and political childhood, its papers depended for
news upon Associated Press post-boys, who, after
meeting incoming schooners at New York, rode hot
haste, or leisurely, according to the character of the
rider and nature of the beast, to the various papers
inland.</p>

<p>To-day the Associated Press sends over 31,000
miles of private telegraph lines, which form a network
across the continent of America, thousands and
thousands of columns, supplying about 3,000 American<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82">82</a></span>
papers with news of what is happening from
minute to minute in America and abroad.</p>

<h4>NETWORK OF WIRES.</h4>

<p>In addition, the Associated Press keeps Europe
and the rest of the world informed of the news of the
great Republic, gathered and distributed by over
2,000 employees, who are supported on an annual
revenue of over half a million sterling.</p>

<p>The Associated Press was started about 1840,
when seven of the New York daily papers combined
to reduce the expense of news by post-boys.</p>

<p>The organization at present consists of over 700
of the leading American daily papers. Each paper
has a vote whereby fifteen directors are elected.
These in turn elect officers. Through contract relations
2,300 other papers are granted the Associated
Press News service, making a total of 3,000 out of
the 3,200 daily papers published in America.</p>

<p>These 3,000 papers have a daily issue of 15,000,000,
and each paper is estimated by an impartial
statistician to pass through the hands of three persons;
hence it is estimated that every despatch sent
by the Associated Press reaches 45,000 pairs of eyes.</p>

<p>The Associated Press is not in itself a profit-making
concern, being purely co-operative, and has
nothing whatever to do with any advertising. Its
papers, which include those of all languages, creeds<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83">83</a></span>
and politics, are assessed according to the expenditure
involved in gathering and distributing the home
and foreign news.</p>

<p>Over its own telegraph wires the Associated Press
sends through its own telegraph operators, east, west,
north and south, the news of the moment.</p>

<h4>SOME QUICK WORK.</h4>

<p>This is received in its branch offices in all the important
towns throughout the United States, and
transmitted to the papers. The result of last year’s
Derby was in the New York office of the Associated
Press, nearly 3,000 miles away, twenty-five seconds
after “Rock Sand” had passed the winning post,
and was published in San Francisco, about 7,000
miles from Epsom, two minutes afterwards.</p>

<p>Interesting as is this system whereby the news of
America and the outside world is simultaneously distributed
to the American papers&mdash;a system of mechanical
ingenuity and organization that would require
several columns to describe adequately&mdash;it
must be almost of secondary importance to English
readers compared with the influence wielded by this
American news agency over matters British and
European.</p>

<p>The Associated Press has treaty relations with the
three great European news agencies, viz., Reuter’s,
which supplies Great Britain, Greater Britain, all the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84">84</a></span>
British possessions, Egypt and the Far East, except
Tonquin, with their news. Havas, which covers
the newsfield of France, and through its subsidiary
agencies all the Latin countries, including South
America; and Wolff’s, which from Berlin controls
and distributes the news of Germany and all the
Teutonic countries, and, through allies, the news of
Russia, Austria-Hungary, the Slav countries, Scandinavia
and Danish territory.</p>

<p>These three European agencies in turn rely upon
tributary agencies such as the Telbureau, in St.
Petersburg; the Stefani, in Rome; the Fabrin, in
Madrid, and the Corresponz, in Vienna&mdash;all official
voices of Government opinion.</p>

<h4>NO SALES IN ENGLAND.</h4>

<p>These European agencies and their tributaries
constitute one great clearing-house of news. Havas
gathers the news of France primarily into Paris;
thence it radiates throughout the world: to Reuter
for England, to the Associated Press for America, to
Stefani for Italy, and so on. In this way a budget
comprising the news of the world appears day by day.</p>

<p>Not content with receiving for its papers the news
of Europe through the agencies already mentioned,
the Associated Press has established in practically all
the European capitals, bureaus of its own. In London
the Associated Press keeps a large staff, though<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85">85</a></span>
no attempt is made to sell a single item of news to
English papers. All their work is to gather news
and send it to America.</p>

<p>In London the staff of the Associated Press, as it
is familiarly called, is under the direct supervision of
Mr. Walter Neef, who is in charge of the entire
European service.</p>

<p>The correspondents resident on the continent are
in close touch with the Chancelleries, and are welcomed
at their respective Foreign Offices with a
kindness that speaks eloquently for the friendship
these European nations are willing to offer to
America.</p>

<p>The first news of the arbitration treaty that sealed
the Anglo-French “entente” was cabled to New
York by the Associated Press from Paris, and re-cabled
to London, where it was promptly denied
by no less an authority than the <cite>Times</cite>. The first
news of the recent Anglo-Spanish treaty came to
England from the Associated Press in New York,
having been cabled from its London office.</p>

<p>When Martinique was devastated by a volcanic
eruption, which included among its victims the correspondent
of the Associated Press at St. Pierre, the
Fort de France representative called on Mr. Melville
E. Stone, the General Manager, then in New
York, for assistance.</p>

<p>Mr. Stone promptly placed a steamer at his service,
and the other correspondents of the Associated<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86">86</a></span>
Press in places of danger were rescued, and lived to
tell to the world the story of that hideous visitation.</p>

<p>This cost the Associated Press about £5,000, and
that is the sum it usually expends on the international
yacht races for the America Cup, which are
reported for England and America by correspondents
and half a dozen special boats equipped with wireless
telegraphic instruments.</p>

<p>When Pope Leo died, London, Paris, Berlin and
other European capitals got the first intimation of
his death from New York. The Associated Press
correspondent in Rome had telegraphed the news on
which all the world waited, and it had arrived in
America exactly nine minutes after having been sent
out from the Vatican, which is nearly two miles
from the central telegraphic office in Rome.</p>

<p>This gave the Associated Press time to re-cable
the news to Europe before it had arrived from
another source. On that day the Associated Press
published in its American papers over one page of
closely printed description of the events centering
round the Vatican, all of which was cabled from
Rome after 4 o’clock on the preceding afternoon.</p>

<p>When Cardinal Sarto was elected Pope, the news
again came to Europe in the same way&mdash;from the
Associated Press office in New York. The decision
of the Alaska Boundary Commission was cabled by
the Associated Press to New York and Canada on a
Saturday, and re-cabled back to England for the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87">87</a></span>
Sunday papers, though it was not officially announced
in London until the following Tuesday.</p>

<p>To come to still more recent events, the news of
the transmission of Russia’s final note to Japan was
received in London from the St. Petersburg correspondent
of the Associated Press via New York,
while despatches from the same agency announced
in America the rupture of diplomatic relations and
the practical outbreak of war as early as Saturday
afternoon on February 6.</p>

<h4>A MANAGERIAL GENIUS.</h4>

<p>Mr. Melville E. Stone, the General Manager and
presiding genius of the Associated Press, whose indomitable
“grit”&mdash;as they say in America&mdash;was the
chief factor in the victory won when the Associated
Press fought for five years for supremacy in America,
has recently paid a flying visit to England, after
being received by the Czar in St. Petersburg and
by the Kaiser in Berlin.</p>

<p>Several other crowned heads have been pleased to
consult with Mr. Stone, who naturally is one of the
most prominent of Americans. He has been decorated
by the King of Italy, the President of the
French Republic, and the Kaiser.</p>

<p>As a result of Mr. Stone’s personal suggestion, the
Czar has removed the censorship on all news that
leaves Russia for abroad.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88">88</a></span>
In a few hours the head of the American news
agency was able to convince the Ruler of All the
Russias that the censorship was not only useless,
but absolutely harmful to the Empire. The tradition
of centuries has been swept away, and, on the
word of the Czar, all the world will be free to have
the individual opinions of correspondents who may
care to come into Russian domain.</p>

<p>No country is likely to benefit more by this decision
of the Czar than Russia itself; no public is
likely to be more slow to realize the genuineness
of the change than that of Europe. The extent of
the revolution effected can scarcely be gauged except
by those who know Russia well.</p>

<p>When asked the other day to what principles this
American news agency owed its ascendancy in the
world, Mr. Stone laconically replied: “Accuracy of
statement and speed in transmission.”</p>

<p>Of such is the Associated Press of America.</p>

<div id="ip_89" class="figcenter" style="width: 384px;"><img src="images/i_089.jpg" width="384" height="600" alt="" /><div class="caption">S.&nbsp;F.&nbsp;B. MORSE.</div></div>

<h3>PROF. S.&nbsp;F.&nbsp;B. MORSE.</h3>

<p>Born April 27, 1791, at Charleston, Mass. His
father, the Rev. Jedediah Morse, author of the well-known
book entitled “American Geography” and
compiler of the “Universal Gazette.” His mother
was Elizabeth Ann Breese.</p>

<p>At seven years of age young Morse entered the
preparatory school at Andover, Mass., and at 14 the
Freshman Class at Yale, graduating in 1810.</p>

<p>The faculty which first developed in him was the
artistic. He provided himself with brush and paint
and commenced taking on ivory the portraits of his
more opulent companions. He found in painting
an inspiration, and selected it as his chosen profession.</p>

<p>He placed himself under the tutelage of Washington
Allston, one of America’s famous artists, who
encouraged him in the choice he had made. He
accompanied Allston to Europe in 1811, bearing introductions
to some of England’s most distinguished
men.</p>

<p>Benjamin West was then in the zenith of his fame.
It was a proud day for Morse when he met West
and was welcomed to his studio. A mutual attachment
sprang up between them, and West became
thereafter his friend and counsellor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90">90</a></span>
Meanwhile West’s friendship and the introductory
letters he had brought with him introduced him to
men of influence and reputation.</p>

<p>Some of their names are historic. It was something
for a young man to meet such men as William
Wilberforce and Henry Thornton, Zacharias MacCauley,
father of the great historian, Lord Glenelg
and many others, all of whom gave a warm and
cordial welcome.</p>

<p>Mr. Morse’s instincts were refined and his companionships
choice. He had for his room-mate in
London the gifted Leslie, then, like himself, struggling
for fame in a sublime art. For companions he had
such men as Benjamin West, Copley, Allston,
Coleridge, Rogers, Charles Lamb and others famous
in art and literature.</p>

<p>He wrote thus to his mother in 1812:</p>

<p>“My passion for my art is firmly rooted, that I
am confident; no human power could destroy it.
The more I study the greater I think is its claim to
the appellation of divine. I am going to begin a
picture of the death of Hercules. The figure is to
be large as life.”</p>

<p>The picture when finished was shown to West
who warmly praised it, and in May, 1813, it was
accepted for exhibition in the rooms of the Royal
Academy, at Somerset House, then regarded as a
very marked token of favor.</p>

<p>A new and unexpected triumph grew out of this<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91">91</a></span>
painting. In executing it he pursued the plan of
conscientious artists who first model in clay the figure
to be painted in order to ensure strict anatomical
proportions and accuracy.</p>

<p>This cast, to which he attached no special value,
was seen by West, and was induced through his
kind criticism to send this model to the Society of
Arts in competition for a prize in sculpture.</p>

<p>This venture proved successful, and was publicly
presented with the annual prize and a gold medal by
the Duke of Norfolk.</p>

<p>In the British Art Reports the “Dying Hercules” is
placed among the nine best paintings in a gallery of
nearly one thousand, and among them the works of
Turner, Northcote, Lawrence and Wilkie.</p>

<p>When young Morse went to Europe he was dependent
to some extent upon his father for his resources.
He was to be away three years. It was now
1815, one year longer than his limit, but he was
ambitious and felt he had the power within him. He
determined to compete for the chief prize offered by
the Royal Academy for a subject he had chosen,
“The Judgment of Jupiter in the case of Apollo,
Marpessa and Idas.” The prize was a gold medal
and fifty guineas.</p>

<p>The picture was completed, and hoping he would
be allowed to compete in his absence, he offered it
for that purpose to West, who, struck with its merits,
advised him to stay, but this he could not do, and the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92">92</a></span>
rules cut him off. The premium had to be delivered
to the successful artist in person.</p>

<p>A petition to make his case an exception was declined,
and “Jupiter” went with its author to
America.</p>

<p>He arrived in Boston, Oct. 18, and, without delay,
rented a studio. He had his “Jupiter” on exhibition,
and his own fame had preceded him. Many
crowded the studio to see both the artist and the
painting.</p>

<p>Society opened its doors, but this was all. No
one offered to buy his picture or give him an order
in the line of high art he had marked out for himself.</p>

<p>After various experiences Mr. Morse settled in
New York, founding the National Academy of the
Arts of Design, of which in 1827 he became President,
and to which office he was annually elected until
1845. He delivered the first course of lectures on the
fine arts ever delivered in America, and they were
notable for suggestiveness and learning.</p>

<p>As an historical painter Morse stood next to
Allston. Had the country demanded art of a very
high order it is probable that Morse would have engaged
his attention as an historical painter, but the
nation was too young, knew little of art and cared less.
Morse was honored, but his art kept him poor. He
longed, however, too, for the opportunity to try his
power on some national work.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93">93</a></span>
He conceived the idea of painting the interior
of Representatives Chamber in the Capital at Washington,
and devoted eighteen months to this. The
picture measured eight feet by nine, and contained
a great variety of figures. Its exhibition, however,
caused him serious loss. The painting is in the
possession of the President of the Arts of Design in
New York.</p>

<p>He painted a picture of General Lafayette, who was
at the time in the United States, and with whom he
by this means formed a warm friendship.</p>

<p>In 1829 he again visited Europe, spending three
years among artists and collectors of art in England,
Italy and France.</p>

<p>In Paris he painted the interior of the Louvre,
copying in miniature the chief pictures hanging on its
walls. In the fall of 1832 he returned to America
and resumed the Presidency of the Academy of Design,
to which he was regularly elected annually during
his absence.</p>

<p>When an artist was employed to fill with a picture
one of the vacant panels in the rotunda of the Capitol,
American artists, without exception, considered Morse
best entitled to the honor, but great disappointment
was felt when another was selected.</p>

<p>It was on his return from Europe on board the
packet-ship “Sully” the idea of the electric telegraph
engaged his attention, but it occupied many years of
his time to bring it to practical shape. He would<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94">94</a></span>
have accomplished this much earlier had he not been
hampered from lack of means.</p>

<p>When his invention was matured and its usefulness
perceived and applied, he was fortunate enough at
last to reap the reward of many years of struggle
and anxiety he had undergone.</p>

<p>On June 5, 1856, with the telegraph established in
America, he again left for Europe. In London he
met with great joy his artist friends: West, Landsear,
Leslie and many others distinguished in science
and art, all of whom warmly congratulated him on
the brilliant career which had been opened up to
him. In their estimation he had honored in this
new realm the old art which he loved and elevated.</p>

<p>Morse’s development from an artist into an inventor
was to them no marvel. He was still giving utterance
to natural forces as when a few years before he
combined his colors on canvass and produced his
“Hercules.”</p>

<p>After enjoying for a time this pleasant reunion
with his old friends in London, he also met and consulted
with the English electricians, Glass, Bright,
Whitehouse and others in respect to the proposed
Atlantic cable in which experiments were then being
made as to its possibility.</p>

<p>He then left for the continent. On his arrival at
Copenhagen, whither he first directed his course, he
was introduced to Frederick VII. King of Denmark,
who, with his Court, received him with every mark<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95">95</a></span>
of honor. There he visited the study chamber of
Oersted, whose discovery of the reflection of a needle
by a galvanic current was the dawning fact which
eventually made his invention possible.</p>

<p>Continuing his journey to Russia, he found on
arriving at the quay at Peterhoff the Imperial carriages
with their usual retinue of footmen wearing
the Royal livery in waiting. By these he and his
party were driven to the Imperial Palace, where,
with every demonstration of respect, he was received
by the Emperor Alexander II., by whom he was
most kindly congratulated as one of the world’s
benefactors.</p>

<p>He next proceeded to Berlin. Here he was received
with great cordiality by Humboldt, who welcomed
him to his house and treated him during his
stay with every mark of respect.</p>

<p>At his departure the great author of Cosmos presented
him with an Imperial photograph of himself,
on the margin of which he wrote:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“To Mr. S.&nbsp;F.&nbsp;B. Morse, whose philosophic and
useful labors have rendered his name illustrious in two
worlds. The homage of the high and affectionate
esteem of</p>

<p class="sigright">
<span class="smcap">Alexander Humboldt</span>.”
</p></blockquote>

<p>This memorial of one so great and gifted he greatly
valued and carefully preserved.</p>

<p>Prussia, about the same time, presented to him the
Prussian golden medal for scientific merit.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96">96</a></span>
After passing through many places of interest in
Europe, in all of which he was received with distinguished
honor, Professor Morse returned to London
the latter part of September, 1856.</p>

<p>The public at that time were much interested in
the subject of the proposed submarine telegraph
connection with America.</p>

<p>A plateau extending across the bed of the ocean
between the two continents had been discovered
under a survey conducted by Lieutenant Maury for
the United States Government, and which was regarded
as extremely favorable for the projected enterprise.</p>

<p>Professor Morse, in concert with Mr. Whitehouse
and Mr. Bright, the English electricians, conducted a
series of experiments and sent signals through 2,000
miles of insulated wire.</p>

<p>These experiments removed any apprehension respecting
the retardation of the electric current over
this long length of wire.</p>

<p>It now became a question of capital and nautical
engineering. The first was quickly pledged, the
latter was not doubted.</p>

<p>While in London thus occupied, Professor Morse
was tendered a banquet, which he promptly accepted.</p>

<p>The dinner was given Oct. 9, 1856. The Chairman
was Mr. Fothergill Cooke, who, in presenting
the guest of the evening, used the following <span class="locked">language:&mdash;</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97">97</a></span>
“Gentlemen, I was consulted only a few months
ago on the subject of a telegraph for a country in
which no telegraph at present exists.</p>

<p>“I recommended the system of Professor Morse.
I believe that system to be one of the simplest in
the world, and in that lies its permanence and certainty.
(Cheers.) It is a great thing to say, and
I do so after twenty years’ experience, that Professor
Morse’s system is one of the simplest that has ever
been, and I think ever will be, conceived. (Cheers.)
He stands alone in America as the original and
carrier-out of a grand conception.</p>

<p>“We know that America is an enormous country,
but I think we have a right to quarrel with Mr. Morse
for not being content with giving the benefit of it to
his country, but that he extended it to Canada and
Newfoundland, and even beyond there. His system
has been adopted over all Europe.</p>

<p>“The nuisance is that we in England are obliged
to communicate by means of his system, and he
threatens to go further still, and promises, if we do
not, he will carry out a communication between England
and Newfoundland across the Atlantic.</p>

<p>“I almost envy Professor Morse for having forced
from an unwilling rival a willing acknowledgment of
his services.</p>

<p>“May he long live to enjoy the high reputation
he has attained throughout the world.” (Long continued
cheers.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98">98</a></span>
Other speeches equally complimentary followed.</p>

<p>It was on the day of this banquet Mr. Morse received
from Paris the announcement that the Emperor
Napoleon III. had made him a Chevalier of
the Legion of Honor.</p>

<p>Martin Farquhar Tupper sent him a few days
afterwards the following lines referring to the banquet:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">“A good and generous spirit ruled the hour,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Old jealousies were drowned in brotherhood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Philanthropy rejoiced that skill and power,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Servants to science, compass all men’s good.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">“And over all religions banner stood<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Upheld by thee, true patriarch of the plans<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which in two hemispheres was chimed, to shower<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Mercies from God on universal man.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">“Yes, the electric chain from East to West,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">More than mere metal, more than mammon, can<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Binds us together, kinsmen in the best<br /></span>
<span class="i2">As most affectionate and frankest bond,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Brothers as one, and looking far beyond,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The world in an electric union blest.”<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>Although the Morse telegraph had been generally
adopted in continental Europe, no compensation had
hitherto been paid to the inventor.</p>

<p>Professor Morse, therefore, was much gratified in
receiving the following letter while in Paris:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99">99</a></span></p>

<blockquote>
<p class="sigright">
<span class="l1">“<span class="smcap">Ministry of Foreign Affairs.</span></span><br />
“<span class="smcap">Paris</span>, September 1, 1858.
</p>

<p>“Sir,&mdash;It is with a lively satisfaction that I have
the honor to announce to you that a sum of 400,000
francs will be remitted to you in four annuities in
the name of France, of Austria, of Belgium, of the
Netherlands, of Piedmont, of Russia, of the Holy
See, of Sweden, of Tuscany and of Turkey, as an
honorary gratuity, and as a reward altogether personal
of your useful labors.</p>

<p>“Nothing can better mark, than this collective act
of reward, the sentiment of public gratitude which
your invention has justly excited.</p>

<p>“The Emperor has already given you a testimonial
of his high esteem, when he conferred on you, more
than a year ago, the decoration of a Chevalier of
the Legion of Honor.</p>

<p>“You will find a new mark of it in the initiative,
which His Majesty wished that his Government
should take in conjunction, and the decision that I
charge myself to bring to your knowledge, is a
brilliant proof of the eager and sympathetic adhesion
that his proposition has met with from the
States I have just enumerated.</p>

<p>“I pray you to accept on this occasion, sir, my
personal congratulations as well as the assurance of
my sentiments of the most distinguished consideration.</p>

<p class="sigright">
<span class="smcap">S. Walewski.</span>”
</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100">100</a></span>
Professor Morse, in addition to this handsome
gratuity, received tokens of honor from each of the
contributing <span class="locked">nationalities:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>From France, the Legion of Honor; Prussia, the
Gold Medal of Scientific Merit; Austria, a gold
medal; Spain, Knight Commander de Numero of
the Order of Isabella the Catholic; Portugal, Knight
of the Tower and Sword; Italy, Saints Lazaro and
Mauritis; Denmark, Knight of the Danneborg;
Turkey, decoration in diamonds of the “Nisham
Iftichar,” or Order of Glory.</p>

<p>He was also the recipient of many other marks of
honor of a more private character.</p>

<p>As early as 1835 Mr. Morse was elected a corresponding
member of the Historical Institute of France.</p>

<p>In 1837 he was made a member of the Royal
Academy of Fine Arts of Belgium.</p>

<p>July 15, 1839, the Silver Medal of the Academy
of Industry was voted to him for the invention of
the telegraph.</p>

<p>The National Institute for the promotion of science,
established at Washington, made him a corresponding
member in 1841, and in 1842 the Gold Medal of
the American Institute was awarded him for successful
experiments in subaqueous telegraphy.</p>

<p>In 1845 he was made a corresponding member of
the Archeological Society in Belgium, and in 1848
he became a member of the American Philosophical
Society of Philadelphia. The following year he was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101">101</a></span>
elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts
and Sciences, Boston.</p>

<p>Many other tokens of honor was accorded him
from time to time.</p>

<p>While in Paris in 1867, the year of the International
Exposition, Professor Morse served on the
Committee of Telegraphic Appliances, and wrote an
exhaustive report on the merits of telegraphic contrivances.</p>

<p>He also prepared with great minuteness a complete
narrative of his own inventions.</p>

<p>Covered with honors, and having long overstepped
the three score years and ten, Professor Morse returned
to America and arrived at his rural home in
Poughkeepsie, N.Y., where he was affectionately
welcomed by friends and neighbors.</p>

<p>Shortly after his return a number of influential and
representative gentlemen of New York felt that
something should be done by his fellow countrymen
to honor the distinguished inventor and welcome
him home.</p>

<p>He was tendered a banquet, which was held at
Delmonico’s on Dec. 30, 1868.</p>

<p>The banqueting room was beautifully decorated
the chair being occupied by the Hon. Salmon P.
Chase. After the dinner the toasts to the Queen of
Great Britain and the Army and Navy had been
responded to by Mr. Thornton, the British Minister,
and General McDowell, the Chairman, said:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102">102</a></span>
“Gentlemen, you will now allow me to invite your
attention to the next regular toast. God has given
understanding to man to be employed for His glory
in promoting the happiness of His creatures and in
nothing that belongs to earth can the human understanding
be more worthily employed than in the researches
of science and in the works of invention.</p>

<p>“Science and invention may be called, perhaps not
unfitly, the creators and servants of civilization.
Sometimes invention by a sort of intuition of principles
has grasped results and seemed to anticipate
science.</p>

<p>“More usually science by the patient investigation
of truth and the discovery of principles has prepared
the way for the triumph of invention. All invention
is realized science, and this is especially true of the
telegraph.</p>

<p>“I will not fatigue your attention with ancient and
modern devices for communicating intelligence at a
distance, but it seems proper to notice here how many
men of science, and of what various nationalities
have contributed to that wonderful art and instrument
by which the world is now bound in electric
chains.</p>

<p>“Many shining names will occur to any one familiar
with the history of the telegraph. Among them I
can pause to mention only those of Volta, the Italian,
to whose discoveries the battery is due; Oersted,
the Dane, who first discovered the magnetic properties<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103">103</a></span>
of the electric current; Ampère and Arago, the
Frenchmen who prosecuted still further and most
successfully similar researches.</p>

<p>“Then Sturgeon, the Englishman, who may be said
to have made the first electric magnet, next, and not
least, illustrious. Among these illustrious men, our
countryman, Henry, who first showed the practicability
of producing electro-magnetic effects by
means of the galvanic current at distances indefinitely
great, and finally Steinheil, the German, who,
after the invention of the telegraph in all material
parts was complete, taught, in 1837, the use of the
ground as part of the circuit.</p>

<p>“These are some of those searchers for truth whose
names will be long held in grateful memory, and not
among the least of their titles to gratitude and
remembrance will be the discoveries which contributed
to the possibility of the modern telegraph.
But these discoveries only made the telegraph possible,
they offered the brilliant opportunity. There
was needed a man to bring into being the new art
and the new interest to which they pointed. And
it is the providential distinction and splendid honor
of the eminent American who is our guest to-night,
that happily prepared by previous acquirements and
pursuits. He was quick to seize the opportunity and
give to the world the first recording telegraph;
fortunate man, thus to link his name forever with the
greatest wonder and the greatest benefit of the age.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104">104</a></span>
“But his work was not done when in 1832 he conceived
the idea and devised the plan of the first telegraph.</p>

<p>“Long years of patient labor and constant perseverance
were needed to bring the telegraph into
use. Its first message was not transmitted until
1844. Even then, and indeed before that year with
something like prophetic inspiration, he grasped
the future and predicted that telegraphic connection
between Europe and America, which it was reserved
for another distinguished American, kindred in spirit
and kindred in renown and illustrious, to accomplish.
Here I must pause, not, however, without uniting all
your aspirations in the fervent wish that our honored
guest may live long and happily to enjoy the applause,
the gratitude and the reverence of mankind,
which he has so honorably won.</p>

<p>“Gentlemen, I now give you ‘Our Guest,’ Prof.
S.&nbsp;F.&nbsp;B. Morse, the man of science who explored the
laws of nature, wrested electricity from her embrace
and made it a missionary in the cause of human progress.”</p>

<p>The venerable Professor then arose amid tumultuous
applause. He was laboring under deep feeling, too
strong to be concealed.</p>

<p>As he did so the whole company made cheer
follow cheer in testimony of their admiration and
respect. At last in a clear voice he addressed the company
at considerable length, reciting the history of
the telegraph, and concluding as follows:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105">105</a></span>
“In casting my eyes around I am most agreeably
greeted by faces that carry me back in memory to
the days of my art struggles in this city, the early
days of the National Academy of Design.</p>

<p>“Brothers (for you are yet brothers if I have left your
ranks), you well know it cost me many a pang. I
did not leave you until I saw you well established
and entering on that career of prosperity due to your
own just appreciation of the important duties belonging
to your profession.</p>

<p>“You have an institution which now holds, and (if
true to yourselves) will continue to hold, a high position
in the estimation of this appreciative community.</p>

<p>“If I have stepped aside from art to tread what
seems another path, there is a good precedent for it
in the lives of artists. Science and art are not
opposed.</p>

<p>“Leonardo da Vinci could find congenial relaxation
in scientific researches and invention, and our own
Fulton was a painter, whose scientific studies resulted
in steam navigation.</p>

<p>“It may not be generally known that the important
invention of the percussion cap is due to the
scientific recreations of the English painter, Shaw; but
I must not further detain you from more instructive
speech. One word only in closing.</p>

<p>“I have claimed for America the origination of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106">106</a></span>
the modern telegraph system of the world; impartial
history, I think, will support that claim.</p>

</div></div>
</div>

<p>Mr. Morse’s address was listened to with deep
attention, and greeted at the close with great and
continued applause.</p>

<p>Among the last, but not the least, of the honors
paid Professor Morse, was the erection of his statue
in Central Park, New York, by the telegraph operators
of the United States and the British provinces.
The ceremony of unveiling the monument took place
on June 10, 1871.</p>

<p>Many delegates were present from all parts of the
country to witness the function.</p>

<p>In the evening a reception was held in the
Academy of Music, at which the aged inventor was
present, when he bade farewell to “his children of
the telegraph.”</p>

<p>He did not long survive this event. He passed
away full of years and honors on April 2, 1872.</p>

<h2><a id="The_Telegraph_in_Canada"></a><i>The Telegraph in Canada</i></h2>

<p>Although the electric telegraph system of Cooke
and Wheatstone had been established as early as
1837 in England, yet no move was made to adopt
it in Canada.</p>

<p>After the Morse experimental line between Baltimore
and Washington had proved a success and was
thrown open for public business and wires were
being carried to the leading business centres in the
United States and a line of telegraph was projected
connecting New York City with Buffalo, public interest
was aroused in Canada, more especially in the
Western section.</p>

<p>Mr. Morse had failed, or probably thought Canada
at that time not important enough, to take out a
patent for his invention, hence it was open to any
or all who chose to use it.</p>

<p>In 1846 the first Canadian Telegraph Company
was formed with a capital of $16,000; its object was
to connect Toronto and Hamilton with the American
lines at Buffalo. The corporate name of the Company
was the “Toronto, Hamilton, Niagara &amp; St.
Catharines Electro-Magnetic Company.”</p>

<p>A line was speedily erected and the desired connection
made.</p>

<p>At the end of this year action was taken at Montreal
to organize a telegraph company.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108">108</a></span></p>

<h3><i>The Origin of the Montreal Telegraph Company</i></h3>

<p>At a meeting of the Council of the Montreal
Board of Trade, held on Dec. 26, 1846, a Committee
was appointed to enquire into the best means
of extending the use of the electric telegraph system
into Canada. The Committee reported favorably of
the project.</p>

<p>After giving the subject full and earnest consideration,
on December 29, three days afterwards, a
general meeting was convened for the purpose of
forming a company to connect Montreal and Toronto
by a line of electro-magnetic telegraph, the capital
to be £12,500 in 1,250 shares of £10 each.</p>

<p>Among those present were L.&nbsp;H. Holton, D.&nbsp;L.
Macpherson, Fred A. Wilson, John Glass, T.&nbsp;W.
Middleton, Thos. Tait, Henry Starnes, John Young,
Henry Joseph, I. Taylor, William Murray, Andrew
Shaw, George Elder, jun., and Henry Chapman.</p>

<p>On motion of L.&nbsp;H. Holton, seconded by D.&nbsp;L.
Macpherson, Mr. Young took the chair.</p>

<p>The Chairman stated the object of the meeting to
be the organization of a company by parties in
favor of connecting Montreal and Toronto by electro-magnetic
telegraph, and who had proposed to take
stock in the company to be formed for that purpose
in accordance with the recommendation of the
Board of Trade.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109">109</a></span>
It was moved by Mr. Elder and seconded by Mr.
Starnes, that the meeting do organize itself into a
company to be entitled the Montreal &amp; Toronto
Magnetic Telegraph Company. This was carried.</p>

<p>It was then moved by Mr. Chapman, seconded by
Mr. Tait, that Messrs. Shaw, Glass, Elder and Young
be a Provisional Committee to conduct the affairs of
the Company.</p>

<p>Moved by Mr. Holton, seconded by Mr. Macpherson,
that the Provisional Committee be empowered
to enter into all necessary arrangements for
the early construction of the proposed line of telegraph,
the whole of the shares having been taken up.</p>

<p>At a meeting held on January 22, 1847, it was
moved by Mr. Lindsay that Andrew Shaw, John
Young, John Glass, George Elder, jun., and Henry
Chapman be directors for the ensuing year&mdash;Carried.</p>

<p>On the 6th of March, 1847, Mr. O.&nbsp;S. Wood was
appointed Superintendent of the Company, and immediately
took charge of the Company’s operations.</p>

<p>The charter was obtained on July 28, 1847, under
the amended title of the Montreal Telegraph Company.</p>

<p>Andrew Shaw was elected its first President, Mr.
James Dakers, Secretary.</p>

<p>In securing the services of Mr. Wood the new
Company was exceedingly fortunate. He had been
associated with Professor Morse, was his first
pupil, and undoubtedly the most experienced telegraph<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110">110</a></span>
man of that day in America, a man of great
ability and of the highest personal character.</p>

<p>Proceedings were immediately begun in construction
work.</p>

<p>The construction of the line between Montreal
and Toronto and Montreal and Quebec was awarded
to Livingston &amp; Wells, the well-known express forwarders,
and by them pushed on with the utmost vigor
under Mr. Wood’s supervision and direction. When
the work was completed it was found to be satisfactory
in every particular, both in material and
workmanship, and became a model for future work
of the kind.</p>

<p>At the close of 1847, 540 miles of line had been
erected, 9 offices opened and 33,000 messages transmitted.</p>

<p>In 1851 Sir Hugh Allan, who had early interested
himself in the fortunes of the Montreal Telegraph
Company, became its President. This office he held
uninterruptedly until his death in 1882.</p>

<p>Immediately on assuming office, Sir Hugh Allan,
in concert with Mr. Wood, projected important extensions
of the lines of the Company, and in a short
time the most remote towns and villages were placed
in telegraphic connection with the chief business centres
of the country.</p>

<p>The Montreal Telegraph Company became one of
the leading institutions in Canada. Many companies
were started to compete in the same line of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111">111</a></span>
business, but in no long time were doomed to failure,
as they neither had the skill, the men nor the money
to enable them to succeed in opposing their more
formidable rival. After placing the Company on a
high pedestal of efficiency, and after 18 years of
strenuous exertions on its behalf, Mr. O.&nbsp;S. Wood
retired from the management in 1865, carrying with
him the esteem and respect of the Company and the
business community generally.</p>

<p>Mr. James Dakers was then placed in charge of the
eastern, and Mr. Dwight of the western section of
the Company’s territory.</p>

<p>The advance and prosperity of the Company continued,
as the foundation had been well and truly laid
by a capable workman.</p>

<p>In 1875 it had in operation 20,000 miles of wire,
1,400 offices and 2,000 employees.</p>

<p>During the preceding year some 2,000,000 messages
were transmitted in addition to millions of
words in press despatches, and the capital increased
to $2,000,000, at which figure it still remains.</p>

<p>In 1881 this splendid old Company was forced
by circumstances which confronted them to lease
their business to another company.</p>

<p>The names of Sir Hugh Allan, O.&nbsp;S. Wood and
James Dakers will always be inseparably associated
with the history of the Montreal Telegraph Company.</p>

<p>The first company to compete against the Montreal<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112">112</a></span>
Telegraph Company was the Grand Trunk
Telegraph Company in 1852&ndash;3, lines were erected
from Buffalo to Quebec, following the lines of the
older Company.</p>

<p>After some years of an unprofitable business they
sold out lock, stock and barrel to the Montreal Telegraph
Company for $11,000.</p>

<p>The next venture was by the Provincial Telegraph
Company, the Canadian ally of the United
States Telegraph Company, which was then spreading
its lines over the United States; but was in 1866
absorbed by the Western Union; this ended the
career of the Provincial, and its plant was purchased
and transferred to the Montreal Company for a
nominal sum.</p>

<p>Some two years later the Dominion Telegraph
Company took form with a capital of $700,000.
This Company proved the most serious opponent of
the Montreal Telegraph Company, but was never
a financial success. In 1878 it was leased by the
American Union Telegraph Company, an opponent
of the Western Union. Both Companies were acquired
by the latter Company, which was busily
occupied in securing a monopoly of the telegraph
business, and succeeded, in a great measure, in
accomplishing its object.</p>

<p>The Dominion Telegraph Company was transferred
to the Great North Western Telegraph Company
of Canada, a subsidiary concern of the American
Company in 1881.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113">113</a></span>
In the lower provinces a move for telegraphic
facilities were made almost concurrent with those of
Western Canada.</p>

<p>During 1847&ndash;48 the Press Association ran a
steamer between Digby, N.S., and Portland, Me.,
to carry news received by the steamships touching at
Halifax, and from thence sent overland by express
riders to Digby, 149 miles, and was sometimes accomplished
in less than eight hours and a half, or at the
rate of 17½ miles an hour, to be despatched from
thence by steamer to Portland and telegraphed to
New York from there in advance of the Cunard
steamers at Boston.</p>

<p>This service was managed with great vigor. The
express rider was the great event of the day as he
flew past Annapolis, his horse white with foam and
the whole population lining the road. A gun was
fired to announce his arrival to the captain of the
steamer immediately anchors were weighed. Steam
raised, the pilot took his place at the wheel and the
small boat manned by athletic seamen was sent
ashore to receive the bag of the express rider, as at
full speed he arrived at the dock.</p>

<p>This process, though full of éclat and splendidly
performed, was expensive, and the Associated Express
agents, offered to guarantee the payment of a
liberal subsidy to any company who would construct
a line of telegraph between Calais, Me., and Halifax,
which could be available for press matter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114">114</a></span>
The Nova Scotia Government came to the rescue
and erected a line of 125 miles in length from
Halifax to Amherst to meet the American and New
Brunswick lines. This line was completed on
Nov. 9, 1849, and Halifax was for the first time connected
telegraphically with New York.</p>

<p>On Oct. 4, 1847, a telegraph company was formed
in New Brunswick with $40,000 capital. Lines connecting
St. John and intervening points with Calais
and Portland were completed Jan. 1, 1849, and
connection with the Nova Scotian Government line
at Amherst was made.</p>

<p>The lines in New Brunswick and Nova Scotia
were acquired by the American Telegraph Company
and later by the Western Union Telegraph Company,
by whom they are now operated.</p>

<p>In 1847 the British North American Telegraph
Company was organized for the purpose of connecting
Quebec and the lower provinces by wire, but
the wire got no further than River du Loup, where
it terminated for a time.</p>

<p>A second company, bearing a similar name, erected
a line between Montreal and Quebec; both properties
were afterwards transferred to the Montreal
Telegraph Company.</p>

<p>In 1849 the Montreal &amp; Troy Company built a
line from Montreal to the Canadian frontier, and
thence to Whitehall, and Troy, after working independently
for a couple years, were purchased by the
Montreal Company.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115">115</a></span>
In 1850 a line from Bytown (now Ottawa) by a
company organized by Joseph Aumond; it also after
a few years became the property of the Montreal Company.</p>

<p>In the West about the same period the Hon. Malcolm
Cameron interested himself in a telegraph line
to connect Hamilton and London, but, after some
18 months of unprofitable labor, was abandoned.</p>

<p>Coming down to a later date the People’s Telegraph
Company was organized and a line erected
between Montreal and Quebec, which proved a
financial failure to the promoters, and served as a
warning to others to avoid going into isolated telegraph
ventures.</p>

<p>In 1881 the Canada Mutual and the Union
Mutual Telegraph Companies worked in conjunction
for a short period in the States and Canada; both
were eventually absorbed by the Western Union.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116">116</a></span></p>

<h3><i>The Great North-Western Telegraph Company</i></h3>

<p>This Company was incorporated on May 7, 1880,
for the purpose of establishing and working telegraph
lines in the Northwest Territory in the district
of Keewatin, Manitoba, and to connect with
lines in the Province of Ontario.</p>

<p>The capital stock, $400,000 in shares of $100
each, with power to increase the capital from time to
time as necessity required, by a resolution of the
Directors, with authority to establish, construct, purchase,
lease or work lines in the Dominion of Canada
by land or water, etc. The head office at the City of
Winnipeg.</p>

<p>At a meeting of the Company held on June 10,
1881, Mr. Erastus Wiman was elected President.</p>

<p>At this meeting Mr. Wiman as President was empowered
to enter into negotiation with the Montreal,
Dominion and Western Union Telegraph Companies
as shall harmonize the interest of the several
named companies subject to confirmation of the
Directors.</p>

<p>Mr. Wiman thus empowered lost no time in effecting
his object.</p>

<p>The resolution quoted is amusing. The Western
Union owned the Dominion Telegraph Company, or<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117">117</a></span>
at least controlled it. There was no discord between
the Western Union and the Montreal Telegraph
Company.</p>

<p>A close and intimate business relationship had
been maintained between these companies for years
and nothing had arisen hitherto to disturb this good
understanding. The Dominion Telegraph Company
had been acquired as an asset of the American
Union Telegraph Company which had been purchased
by the Western Union and was a white
elephant on its hands and of which they naturally
enough were anxious to get rid of.</p>

<p>It was offered to the Montreal Company, but the
offer was not entertained as the wires of the Dominion
Company merely paralleled its own, and its own
wires were sufficient for its own business at that time.
Mr. Wiman, being familiar with the position of
affairs, saw a chance for a deal and the future monopoly
of the telegraph business of Canada.</p>

<p>He got the refusal of the lease of the Dominion
Company and to some extent his plans were approved
by the Western Union and of which they
were more or less informed. He then made his
purpose known to the Directorate of the Montreal
Telegraph Company, that they should hand over
their business to his company on a 99 years’ lease
and a compensation of 8 per cent. per annum on
the paid-up capital stock of $2,000,000 would be
paid, guaranteed by the Western Union Telegraph
Company.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118">118</a></span>
The Directors, as a matter of course, were aghast
with astonishment at the audacity of the proposal.</p>

<p>A company with a nominal capital, recently
formed, with no one of standing in its make up to
suggest the idea, was too preposterous. However,
Mr. Wiman coolly told them they had better think
it over, that unless his terms were accepted his
Company, the Dominion and the Western Union,
behind them, would go into competition with them
for Canadian business. A meeting of shareholders
decided, after a stormy and exciting discussion, to
accept the terms offered.</p>

<p>The transfer was made on July 1, 1881.</p>

<p>The big fish swallow the smaller usually, but in
this case it was the extraordinary feat of a small
fish swallowing a bigger one.</p>

<p>When the agreement took effect Mr. James
Dakers resigned and was succeeded as Secretary by
Mr. D. Ross Ross.</p>

<p>Mr. Dwight was appointed General Manager of
the Great North-Western Company and most of the
officials and employees of the Montreal Telegraph
Company were retained by him. Owing to his able
management the Company has been successful
in every way; all its obligations have been met with
punctuality and regularity.</p>

<p>Mr. Wiman resigned the Presidency some ten
years ago and Mr. Dwight succeeded him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119">119</a></span>
In 1902 it had 17,838 miles of line, 35,721 miles
of wire, over 2,000 offices and transmitted 2,795,278
messages, not including press despatches.</p>

<p>Recently Mr. Dwight resigned the management
and was succeeded by Mr. I. McMichael.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120">120</a></span></p>

<h3><i>Canadian Pacific Railway Telegraph</i></h3>

<p>In the charter of the Canadian Pacific Railway
Company it had power to carry on a commercial
telegraph business throughout the Dominion of
Canada.</p>

<p>The telegraph lines of this company were constructed
concurrently with the railway which was
begun in 1880 and completed in 1885.</p>

<p>The following year the company inaugurated the
commercial telegraph business and Mr. C.&nbsp;R.
Hosmer was appointed General Manager of this
branch of the company’s business; this selection was
recognized as a fortunate one for the company; no
better qualified man could have been found in
Canada than he to properly fill this important position.
It was no light task he had undertaken, to
equip and man the numerous stations as they
were opened up for business, covering such a vast
extent of territory as well as to enter into competition
with a long established telegraph system
through the more populous sections in the East.
About this time the Postal Telegraph Cable Company
was reorganized in the United States, and the
Commercial Cable established, and a working
arrangement made between these companies and
the Canadian Pacific Telegraph for interchange of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121">121</a></span>
traffic, which has proven mutually beneficial to each
company concerned.</p>

<p>The lines of the Canadian Pacific System traverse
from Halifax to Vancouver, including numerous
branch lines.</p>

<p>The Postal Telegraph Cable Company cover
nearly every state and territory in the United States.
A direct connection is made with the Government
Cable to Australia at Vancouver and with the Commercial
Cable Company at Canso, N.S.</p>

<p>In 1902 the Canadian Pacific Telegraph System
had in operation 9,736 miles of line and 41,354 miles
of wire, 1,022 offices and transmitted during that year
2,053,000 messages, not including press matter or
railway messages.</p>

<p>The Company has two number six copper wires
extending from Montreal to Vancouver.</p>

<p>About four years ago Mr. Hosmer resigned; he
was succeeded by Mr. James Kent, formerly Superintendent
of the Eastern division. Under him there
are five divisional Superintendents, <span class="locked">namely:&mdash;</span></p>

Recently the Company erected on the former site
of its Head Offices in Montreal a handsome fire-proof
structure of white brick with Ohio stone
facings, seven stories in height, combining in its
interior every comfort and convenience for the large
staff of employees.</p>

<p>The operating room is spacious, well lighted from
three sides, and furnished with the latest designs of
office fittings and electrical appliances.</p>

<p>The telegraph service of the Company is admirably
conducted and doubtless is not the least profitable
of the many enterprises in which it has engaged
in.</p>

<p>It was through the continued and persistent urging
of the late Capt. Fortin, member for Gaspé, that the
Dominion Government was at length aroused to the
necessity of providing efficient telegraph facilities
in the Gulf and the lower St. Lawrence.</p>

<p>The splendid telegraph system, now in operation,
forms a fitting monument to his memory and is alike
creditable to the Government which created it and
carried it out.</p>

<p>During the past twenty years since it was first
initiated, there has been erected 5,481 miles of land
wire lines, and 225 miles of submarine cables laid.</p>

<p>One line on the north shore from Murray Bay to
Belle Isle is over 1,000 miles in length and there
are over 200 miles on the Island of Anticosti connecting
the various lighthouses. Extensions are
constantly being made as necessity arises.</p>

<p>In the Northwest territory 607 miles of line connect
Selkirk with Edmonton with intermediate
stations and from Ashcroft to Dawson 1,826 miles,
from Hazleton to Port Sampson, B.C., 200 miles.</p>

<p>At the end of 1902 there were 222 Government
Telegraph Stations, 89,400 messages transmitted
and a revenue of $114,266 derived. The expenditure
was $208,968.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124">124</a></span>
All signal and meteorological messages are sent
without charge.</p>

<p>The Government Telegraph System is under the
jurisdiction of the Department of Public Works.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Remarks.</span></h3>

<p>The commercial telegraph business of the Dominion
is carried on, and has been for many years, by
the Great North-Western, the Canadian Pacific
and the Western Union Telegraph Companies&mdash;the
latter in New Brunswick and Nova Scotia.</p>

<p>The Anglo-American Telegraph Company has the
monopoly in Prince Edward Island and Newfoundland.</p>

<p>The Canadian Government Telegraphs operate in
territory where it would not be profitable for commercial
telegraph companies to enter. The competing
companies each get a fair share of patronage
by exercising care and promptitude in handling the
business placed in their hands. The Canadian
public have every reason to feel satisfied with the
telegraphic facilities provided by these companies
and can take pride in the fact that no better exists
anywhere, or in any country.</p>

<p>The rates are reasonable when the great distances
covered are taken into account.</p>

<p>It is gratifying to know that they are doing a
thriving business, every year showing better results,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125">125</a></span>
all sharing in the universal prosperity felt throughout
the country now and for years gone by.</p>

<p>The following sketches of prominent and well-known
telegraph men, some of whom are living, and
others who have passed away, will be of interest to
many Canadian readers.</p>

<p>Preceding these brief portraitures are a few reminiscent
tales recalled at random, chiefly Canadian
incidents of “days that are gone.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_126">126</a></span></p>

<h4><i>The Fall of Sebastopol.</i></h4>

<p>I was in the service of the Montreal Telegraph
Company at the head office in Montreal. One day
the Superintendent summoned me to his presence.
He directed me to proceed at once to Sherbrooke
as the operator in charge there was very sick and
unable to discharge his duties.</p>

<p>I left by the first train and reached my destination
the same evening. On arrival I noticed a great
crowd of people awaiting the train. Something unusual
must have happened surely.</p>

<p>I immediately reported myself to the station master,
and was considerably astonished when he seized
me by the shoulder, rushed me across the passage to
the telegraph office, ordered me to call up Montreal
and enquire if the rumored fall of Sebastopol was
true. This I did and found the report confirmed.
This was on the 20th day of September, 1855. A
Cunard steamer arrived at Halifax that afternoon
bringing the news which was flashed over the wires
by the Associated Press.</p>

<p>Montreal sent a full report, which came in on the
old style recording instrument. A newspaper man
came in and volunteered to write it down as I read
it off the paper reel. Each sheet when finished was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_127">127</a></span>
read aloud to the crowd outside. The despatch
ended and the people dispersed.</p>

<p>Next evening the event was celebrated by illuminations,
bonfires, <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">feu de joies</i>, etc. The local militia
turned out <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">en masse</i>, headed by Captain Ibbotson,
loyal and patriotic songs sung, and universal joy
was manifested by all.</p>

<p>At that period the town was largely populated by
English railway men and mechanics who had been
brought here by the Grand Trunk Railway Company
when the road opened up a short time before.
There was also a considerable number of retired naval
and military veterans in the town and neighborhood,
some of whom had fought under Nelson and Wellington.
All of these took a keen interest in the fate
of the British army in the Crimea, and were
naturally overjoyed at the defeat of the enemy and
of the victory achieved.</p>

<p>Sebastopol fell on Sept. 8, 1855, and the war was
virtually ended.</p>

<p>Montreal, Toronto and every town and village
in Canada celebrated the event with the greatest
delight, but it is safe to say that nowhere was there
more hearty rejoicing than in the capital city of the
Eastern Townships on the occasion referred to.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_128">128</a></span></p>

<h4><i>How a Duel was Prevented.</i></h4>

<p>One day during the winter 1856 I received a telegram
from Richmond, a station on the Grand Trunk
Railway, about 25 miles distant, addressed to the
High Constable at Sherbrooke to the effect that a
party of gentlemen were on the southbound train
with the object of fighting a duel when the American
frontier was reached, the party consisting of the
principals, seconds and surgeons, and to have the
whole party arrested.</p>

<p>Seeing the importance of the message due measures
were taken to have it delivered promptly.
The minions of the law were duly on hand and
secured their prey on the arrival of the train. The
party were much surprised, as they had taken
every precaution to keep the affair a profound secret
and were ignorant as to how the matter had leaked
out. All were placed under arrest and escorted to
the Magog House. They had come from Quebec.
The nature of the quarrel I am unable to say.</p>

<p>They were brought before a magistrate and admitted
the object of their journey, when each and
severally were released on their own recognances.
All promised to abandon their evil intentions and
return to the ancient capital forthwith.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_129">129</a></span>
Having nothing special to interest them for a time
they adjourned to the bar-room of that famous
hostlery, then carried on by Mr. Cheney, the flowing
bowl passed round with the result that a reconcilation
was effected, and the rest of the evening spent
in harmony and good feeling.</p>

<p>The only one who refused to come to terms of
amity was one of the sawbones of the party! He
would have none of it.</p>

<p>They departed from Sherbrooke the following day,
if not sadder, at least, wiser men.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_130">130</a></span></p>

<h4><i>Reading by Sound.</i></h4>

<p>In the early days of telegraphy I was employed at
an important station on the Grand Trunk Railway
as commercial and railway operator. One night,
after a busy day’s labor, I was preparing to leave when
I overheard the office call sounded from the relay,
the local battery having been disconnected, as was
then the custom when leaving for the night, for
economical reasons. I answered the call and ventured
to receive the message from the sound of the
relay, and in this found no difficulty whatever.</p>

<p>Whilst thus engaged the locomotive foreman stepped
in. Singular enough, the communication was for
him. He was rather astonished at my receiving a
message in this fashion and expressed his surprise.
He spoke to others about it, and the affair in time
reached the ears of the Railway Telegraph Superintendent,
who, thereupon, called me up on the wire
and gave me a severe reprimand. A “23” or circular
was sent immediately thereafter to the effect
that it had come to his knowledge that certain
operators were in the habit of reading by sound instead
of from the register, with which all stations were
provided, and warning all to desist from this dangerous
practice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_131">131</a></span>
The modern operator will be inclined to smile at
this bit of ancient history.</p>

<p>In no very long time, after the custom became
general in both railway and commercial telegraphy,
the Recording instrument, upon the perfecting of
which Professor Morse had spent so much time and
labor, was abandoned, and the more convenient
method of reading by sound substituted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_132">132</a></span></p>

<h4><i>A Cheeky Operator.</i></h4>

<p>My predecessor at a certain station on the Grand
Trunk Railway vacated his position rather suddenly
by reason of the following colloquy, and against
whom many and frequent complaints had been made.</p>

<p>On one occasion the General Manager happened
to step off the train to interview the station master.
Amongst other subjects spoken of was the troublesome
operator. He immediately stepped across the
passage to have audience with the obnoxious telegrapher.</p>

<p>In a very impressive tone he said, “Young man,
I hear a great many complaints against you. You
had better be careful or I shall have you discharged.”</p>

<p>The operator not knowing the General Manager
from Adam, never having seen him before, looked at
him in surprise, and said, “Who in the blank are
you, anyway?”</p>

<p>“I am Mr. Bidder. Be careful, sir.”</p>

<p>“I don’t care a blank whether you are Mr. Bidder
or Mr. Auctioneer,” turned on his heel and walked
away.</p>

<p>It may be explained that, although doing railway
telegraph work, he was actually employed by the
telegraph company, and believed the railway company<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_133">133</a></span>
had nothing to do with him, in this he was
mistaken. This interview more than confirmed the
numerous complaints, and the services of the youth
were immediately dispensed with.</p>

<p>Mr. S. P. Bidder was the first General Manager of
the Grand Trunk Railway of Canada.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_134">134</a></span></p>

<h4><i>All Fools’ Day Incident.</i></h4>

<p>In the year 1855, when the Government of Canada
was located at Quebec, a Militia Bill was passed,
dividing the militia into active and sedentary, the
first to consist of volunteer troops of various grades
and classes. Provision was made for dividing the
country into military districts, regimental divisions
and battalion divisions, with officers for each. This
was the first step towards the organization of a
regular volunteer force in Canada.</p>

<p>At Sherbrooke there was considerable political
wire-pulling on behalf of those who were ambitious
of being appointed as officers of the company to be
raised at that place. One individual claimed that he
was certain of getting command of the new company
and ridiculed the idea of any one else having the
slightest chance of getting the appointment. This
rather nettled one or two who were equally ambitious
for the honor, and a conspiracy was entered into to
perpetrate a practical joke at his expense.</p>

<p>A certain gentleman called at the telegraph office
and requested the favor of a telegraph blank and
envelope, explaining the purpose for which they were
intended. I hesitated over the matter, but was
assured he would be responsible should any trouble
arise. I reluctantly consented. The result was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_135">135</a></span>
a message was concocted as coming from the
Militia Department at Quebec to the effect that the
Department were pleased to inform the recipient
that he had been appointed to the command of the
company at Sherbrooke and that his commission for
same would be duly forwarded by mail.</p>

<p>The victim was elated over the psuedo despatch
and took special pains to show it to those who
doubted his success.</p>

<p>One person, to whom he confided the contents to
and who was one of the conspirators, doubted its
being genuine, remarking, the Militia Department
was not likely to inform appointees by telegraph. He
thought it a joke, and come to think of it, this was
April Fool Day. This led the irate individual to
me, when he desired to be informed, when the message
was received, handing to me the bogus telegram.
I, of course, felt in a very awkward position. I
scanned it over for a minute and told him the message
had not come through my office. He thereupon
went off like a shot in a very dangerous mood.</p>

<p>He wrote the Superintendent enclosing the alleged
telegram and threatened an immediate action against
the Company for allowing its property to be the
medium of such a trick as was the one complained of.</p>

<p>I was in a rather bad fix. I explained the whole
matter as it occurred. The instigator of the hoax
came to my rescue and assumed all responsibility;
the threatened action was not taken and the matter<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_136">136</a></span>
was soon forgotten, but a new rule was embodied in
the Company’s instruction book to agents and
operators forbidding inside blanks to be allowed to
go out of the office under any pretense whatever,
except on the business of the Company. This rule
is still in force.</p>

<p>The one actually appointed to command the Company
was the originator of the joke herein related.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_137">137</a></span></p>

<h4><i>An Angry Frenchman.</i></h4>

<p>One day the hired man of the village curé
handed me a sealed letter and twenty-five cents, upon
receiving which I tore open the envelope in order to
count the words in the message before transmission.</p>

<p>I had no sooner done this when an angry cry proceeded
from the throat of Jean Baptiste, who held
up his hands, and, with a look of terror in his face,
told me in broken English that it was not for me, but
for the priest at St. Hyacinthe. Had there not been
a high counter between us, it might have gone hard
with me.</p>

<p>I took in the situation, however, politely begged
pardon, I had made a mistake, and put the contents
in a fresh envelope, readdressed it and thrust the
missive into a box under the counter, the receptacle
for the paper from the recording instrument on
which messages were received, and then gave the key
a few taps, all this being within the purview of the
anxious messenger.</p>

<p>I now told him it was all right, the message had
gone. He then departed with a smile of satisfaction
on his face and a courteous <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">remerci monsieur</i>.</p>

<p>Shortly after I resurrected the message and sent it
over the wire in the orthodox fashion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_138">138</a></span>
The little trick practiced and the ignorance shown
may seem like romancing, but at that date even
many well-informed persons on other subjects were
quite as ignorant as this simple servant man of the
<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">modus operandi</i> of electric telegraphy at that period.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_139">139</a></span></p>

<h4><i>Pirating a Press Despatch.</i></h4>

<p>A certain well-known colonel of militia in Montreal,
now deceased, who had been in the telegraph
service in his boyhood and an expert operator, told
me the story I am about to relate illustrative of
primitive telegraph days.</p>

<p>We were swapping old-time telegraph stories when
he exchanged the following: He was in the employ
of the old British American Telegraph Company.
One day, the wires down, which happened
too often, unfortunately, Bob having nothing to
occupy his time, sauntered over to the vicinity of the
Montreal Telegraph Company, on St. Sacrament
Street. It was with a feeling of envy he heard the
busy ticking of the instruments there when those of
his Company were dead as a door nail. He lingered
for a moment or two beneath the office window,
which was only a few feet above; it was in summer
and the windows were all open and he could plainly
deciper everything passing over the wire. One item
of some importance attracted his attention when the
idea struck him he had better take it down. He took
his pencil and note-book, copied the item, went back
to his office, had it manifolded and distributed to
the press. Later on the same was sent out by the
other Company, but in a more leisurely fashion; this
was refused, on the ground that it was already received<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_140">140</a></span>
over the wires of the British American; this
caused much mortification to the older Company to
be beaten by their insignificant rival.</p>

<p>Reading by sound of the instrument was not a
common occurrence then, and especially on the
public highway.</p>

<p>The Montreal Company never became aware of
the trick that was played upon them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_141">141</a></span></p>

<h4><i>The Queen’s Message.</i></h4>

<p>When in August, 1858, the Atlantic cable had
been successfully laid, uniting two continents telegraphically,
there was universal rejoicing. The
Queen sent a congratulatory message to “Her Good
Friend,” the President of the United States, to
which a suitable reply was returned.</p>

<p>The brevity of the Queen’s message was somewhat
disappointing compared with the more lengthy reply
of the President, and many unfavorable comments
were made in the press and in conversation.</p>

<p>However, it was afterwards learned that only a
portion of the communication had been received
owing to a temporary interruption of the cable.
When at last the completed message came there was
no reason for disappointment, and general satisfaction
was evinced.</p>

<p>Small pieces of the unused cable of about an inch
to two or three inches in length mounted with brass
or silver ferrules were sold on the street by speculators
from 25 cents to a dollar each. The event was
celebrated with great éclat on both sides of the
Atlantic.</p>

<p>Banners were displayed with numerous devices
and quotations from Scripture such as, “Their line is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_142">142</a></span>
gone out through all the earth and their words to the
end of the world,” and from Shakespeare, “I will
put a girdle round the earth in forty minutes.”</p>

<p>There were torchlight processions, displays of fireworks,
illuminations, etc., etc., together with addresses
by distinguished men in honor of the event.
I refer more particularly to Ogdensburg, N.Y., where
I was then situated as operator and received the
Queen’s message over the wire.</p>

<p>The rejoicing unfortunately was somewhat premature.</p>

<p>After working more or less imperfectly for three
weeks, the cable gave out completely on the 1st of
September after the transmission of 730 messages
had been effected.</p>

<p>The cable operator at Heart’s Content, Newfoundland,
named De Sauty, sent daily bulletins to the
press holding out strong hopes for the restoration of
the interrupted communication, but these hopes
were not realized. The bulletins ceased and he
disappeared and was never heard of again, at least
by the public.</p>

<p>It is in allusion to this mysterious individual that
Dr. Oliver Wendell Holmes wrote the following
humorous lines, and in fine satirical vein thought
that with a Latin tutor and a professor of chemistry
the educated classes would understand it.</p>

permanently established, but the mysterious De

<h4><i>Testing the Cable.</i></h4>

<p>In the fall of 1856 the Montreal Telegraph Company
laid a subaqueous cable across the St. Lawrence
connecting Ogdensburg, N.Y., with its Canadian
lines. Everything went well till the breaking up of
the ice in the spring, when the American end of the
cable was carried away from its moorings.</p>

<p>A man was sent from Montreal to effect the necessary
repairs. When he arrived, I, then being in
charge of the office there, decided to accompany him
and render any assistance I could. A boat was
hired to row over to the lighthouse where the cable
terminated. The craft engaged was rather frail and
shaky, with quite a heavy sea running. The Montreal
man got safely seated, clutching the side of the
boat with one hand and the testing instrument in
the other. It was a cold day in March, a stiff north-wester
was blowing. When all was ready the painter
was untied, when I jumped, and in doing so lost my
balance and went in headforemost. As I bobbed up
the heels of my friend were just visible above the
water. We succeeded in getting ashore safely, but
the testing instrument had gone to the bottom, which
we tried to recover, but failed, and the trip for the
time was given up.</p>

<p>My companion in this adventure was the late Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_147">147</a></span>
Bowman, for many years the respected storekeeper
for the Montreal Telegraph Company.</p>

<p>In meeting we often reverted to this episode in
our telegraph experience and of our involuntary
bath in the icy St. Lawrence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_148">148</a></span></p>

<h4><i>Cutting Down the Liberty Pole.</i></h4>

<p>In 1857 the following amusing incident occurred
and will be remembered by some of the older inhabitants
of the pretty American city on the south
bank of the St. Lawrence where I was then the
agent of the Montreal Telegraph Company.</p>

<p>The villagers (it was a village at that period) had
made every preparation for the due celebration of Independence
Day with more than ordinary care, and
all were looking forward to the event with eagerness,
especially the more youthful element of the population.
The first ceremony observed at sunrise was to
raise old glory to the apex of the liberty pole, which
stood at the corner of Ford and Water Streets, but, to
the amazement of the party to whom this duty was
assigned, there was no pole to be seen. On a close
examination they found nothing remaining but the
stump of the flag-staff. The question was: Who were
the ruffians that dared to perpetuate the outrage?
None other surely that some scoundrels from the
opposite side of the river. In this surmise they
were not far from the truth. After indulging in
language more forcible than elegant, like practical
Americans, they set to work, erected a temporary
flag-staff and the ceremonies of the day were carried
out without further incident. It was discovered to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_149">149</a></span>
be a case of <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">lex talionis</i> on the part of some young
men from Prescott who rowed across the river during
the night and performed this piece of vandalism
in revenge for a foray made by some young fellows
from Ogdensburg on the previous 24th of May (the
Queen’s Birthday), when they removed the British
flag flying on the old Windmill at Prescott, and substituted
the Stars and Stripes. When this fact
became known the Ogdensburg people had to
acknowledge it was a case of tit for tat and served
them right.</p>

<p>Fortunately these youthful pranks were condemned
by all right thinking people on both sides of
the border and were not repeated.</p>

<h4><i>The Burns Centenary.</i></h4>

<p>On the 25th day of January, 1859, the birthday
centenary of Robert Burns, the Scottish poet, was
enthusiastically commemorated by his admirers on
both sides of the Atlantic, and, in fact, everywhere
throughout the Globe where Scotchmen were to the
fore.</p>

<p>It was generally observed in the form of a
banquet at which eminent literary and public men
were the speakers who paid glowing tributes to the
merits and genius of the peasant poet. Many of
these addresses are still preserved.</p>

<p>In the town of Brockville, where I was located, a
musical and literary entertainment was held in the
Metropolitan Hall, the chairman being the Hon.
James Morris. It was well attended by the leading
people of the town. During the progress of the
entertainment telegraphic congratulatory messages
were interchanged between the chairmen of the
different meetings then being held in Canada, and
the United States, generally couched in lines and
phrases from the poet’s works. The chairman gave
an eloquent address; other speakers also contributed
and the musical programme was excellent, but one
gentleman had prepared with much care a paper on
the Life and Character of Burns, which was admitted<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_151">151</a></span>
to be the gem of the evening by all who heard it,
but unfortunately very few did.</p>

<p>The person referred to was a well-known M.D.
who was afflicted with deafness; he spoke in a very
low tone of voice, like many who suffer from a
similar infirmity. The paper was long, the night was
getting late; before he was through, the audience
showed signs of weariness, which the chairman
noticed, when he rose and begged the Doctor to
kindly curtail his paper as the night was advancing
and he had several other items on the programme
but the chairman’s request was unheard and unconsciously
ignored. The audience had to patiently
endure the martyrdom to the end, a few meanwhile
retiring in disgust.</p>

<p>When the end did come the people were so
delighted at being relieved of the infliction that he
was generously applauded, when with an amiable
smile, and bowing right and left in acknowledgment,
resumed his seat in happy ignorance that he had
been a very tiresome bore indeed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_152">152</a></span></p>

<h4><i>The Prince of Wales at Brockville.</i></h4>

<p>When in August, 1860, H.&nbsp;R.&nbsp;H. The Prince of
Wales (now King Edward) and party had arranged
to visit Brockville, the event was looked forward to
with every manifestation of delight, and arrangements
made to give them a hearty reception.</p>

<p>The route of the Royal party was from Ottawa,
where a visit had been made, and recently named
the capital city of Canada by Queen Victoria; there
they embarked, sailing up the Ottawa River to
Arnprior and thence by carriages to Almonte, and
there entrained for Brockville. All the villages and
hamlets passed were prettily decorated for the occasion,
here and there evergreen arches were erected
where the loyal denizens assembled and heartily
cheered his Royal Highness in passing.</p>

<p>Brockville was reached about nine p.m. The
Royal party was received by the Mayor, Warden of
Leeds and Grenville and other officials. Addresses
were presented and replied to by H.R.H. Carriages
were in waiting to convey them to the steamer at
the dock, by which they were to leave at daybreak
for Kingston.</p>

<p>The Royal party were escorted from the railway
station to the steamboat wharf by a guard of honour,
followed by a procession of firemen and citizens<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_153">153</a></span>
carrying torches. All the buildings on the way were
brightly illuminated, the church bells merrily ringing
with a fine display of fireworks and the loud
ovation of the people made it a memorable scene.</p>

<p>Instead of departing at daybreak, as had been
arranged, it was about three in the afternoon before
the steamer left. The detention was caused by
difficulties which had arisen at Kingston. The
Orange body there had erected an arch decorated
with emblems of the order and which the Royal party
would necessarily have to pass under. An address
by the Orangemen was to be presented, to which the
Duke of Newcastle was unable to assent. While the
settlement of this was being arranged by telegraph
wire, the Mayor, accompanied by many prominent
citizens, waited on the Duke and invited the Royal
party to a drive through the town, which was
graciously accepted, thus giving the people an
opportunity of seeing H.&nbsp;R.&nbsp;H. to better advantage.
In appearance he was of medium height, pale complexion,
modest in demeanor and dignified in
manner.</p>

<p>He wore a tall white hat, a dark morning coat,
light tweed trousers, patent leather boots and light
tan coloured gloves. He bowed in acknowledgment
to the cheers which greeted him and seemed
to enjoy the drive.</p>

<p>It was said the Duke remarked he was not sorry
at the detention as it had given the party the
pleasure of seeing the pretty town by daylight.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_154">154</a></span>
There was a large entourage of pressmen reporting
the Royal progress; one American correspondent
when writing up his report asked me among other
questions how many people were in the torchlight
procession. I told him 500, that being the number
of torches purchased by the town council. Oh! he
said, I’ll make it 5,000, and sure enough he did and
I sent this over the wire.</p>

<p>The whole population, men, women and children,
at that period was a trifle over 4,000. This man
afterwards became a famous correspondent during
the American Civil War.</p>

<p>The fearful and wonderful reports received from
the seat of war as to the extraordinary numbers of
killed, wounded and captured, especially during
the early stages of the trouble were something
incredible; the experience narrated showed the need
of a large discount being made.</p>

<p>The carriage the Prince of Wales drove through
Brockville, and owned by a private gentlemen until
his death, is now, or was until lately, doing duty as a
public conveyance.</p>

<p>Should this meet the eye of some wealthy
American, it might be a good thing for the cabby.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_155">155</a></span></p>

<h4><i>The Trent Affair.</i></h4>

<p>It was on November 8, 1861, that Admiral Wilkes,
in command of the United States frigate <i>San Jacinto</i>
intercepted the British R.&nbsp;M. Steamer <i>Trent</i> on her
way from the West Indies to England and forcibly
removed therefrom the two confederate States Commissioners
Mason and Slidell. When the outrage became
known there was a universal burst of indignation
felt at the affront in Great Britain and all the
British possessions. Every one believed that unless
the men were given up and the act disavowed war between
the two countries was inevitable. A large
military contingent was despatched from England
on the Steamship <i>Persia</i> which arrived at Rimouski
on Christmas day, Dec. 25, 1861. A Queen’s messenger
was sent to Washington bearing an ultimatum from
the British Government demanding that the men be
at once released.</p>

<p>The American Government were in a dilemma.
Several members of the Cabinet were in favor of
resisting this demand, but President Lincoln, with his
characteristic common sense said “One war at a
time, gentlemen, one war at a time,” and the
commissioners were surrendered and transferred to a
British man-of-war at New York on January 1st,
1862, and <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">amende honorable</i> made.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_156">156</a></span>
While the negotiations between the American and
British Governments were in progress, the government
and people of Canada were watching the trend
of events with the keenest interest, and preparations
were made for possible eventualities, flank companies
at the respective military districts were ordered to
prepare for active service.</p>

<p>When this order came by telegraph to the colonel
of Brockville District, I delivered it personally and
took occasion to inform him that if he would give
me a commission in the company going on active
service I was prepared to join at a moment’s notice.
This request pleased the veteran (he was out in the
rebellion) giving me a hearty grip. “You’re the right
sort. I accept your services and shall have a commission
for you within a week.”</p>

<p>A few days after I was much gratified when I
received a large envelope containing my promised
commission, the same being initialled by the Hon.
James Morris, the speaker of the Legislative Council
and resident of Brockville; a short time thereafter
while visiting his home he entered the telegraph office
to send a message. I took this opportunity of thanking
him for the commission he sent me. He glared
at me for a second or two and said, “The commission
is not for you; it is for John Murray the butcher.”
“Oh! indeed, I beg pardon. I was under the impression
it was for J.&nbsp;M.&mdash;&mdash; gentleman.” I did not
get this off in a resentful mood; it was merely repeating<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_157">157</a></span>
the language of the document. Of course I
handed it over to my namesake, the rightful owner,
a very respectable man of the town, when my
military ambitions came to an end.</p>

<p>The services of the flank companies were not
required after the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">causes belle</i> had been removed and
Canada once more resumed her usual peace footing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_158">158</a></span></p>

<h4><i>The Old Soldier and the Parson.</i></h4>

<p>About forty odd years ago when I was acting in
the capacity of telegraph, express and steamship
agent at Brockville, the following incident happened,
which may be worth recalling: One day an old
gentleman entered the office and desired me to furnish
a steamship ticket to Liverpool. He informed
me he was on his way to revisit his native land which
he had not seen for many years. He was in the army
previous to settling in one of the back townships.
Although well on in years he looked hale and hearty,
straight as an arrow and a remarkably handsome
old fellow.</p>

<p>After completing his purchase and about to depart,
he observed a pair of Fairbanks scales and requested
me to weigh him, as he would like to see whether
he lost or gained on the voyage. Whilst occupied
in this, another old gentleman walked in attentively
watching the operation; he also requested
me to do a similar favor for him. He proved very
much lighter and somewhat disappointed, and remarked:
“Well, you are heavier than I, but I think
I can beat you in length of years.” “How old are
you?” brusquely querried the old soldier. “I am
84,” looking triumphantly at his questioner. “My
young friend I am 85. I am heavier than you, older<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_159">159</a></span>
than you and (whispering in his ear) can look at the
girls yet!”</p>

<p>Singular enough, the name of the latter was Mr.
Young, the former the Rev. Wm. Smart, a well-known
and respected clergyman, whose chief
weakness was a certain vanity in his length of years,
coupled with activity and good health on which he
greatly prided himself. He was therefore, considerably
humiliated at being thus so badly taken down
and his dignity ruffled by the above remark.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_160">160</a></span></p>

<h4><i>The Fenian Scare.</i></h4>

<p>When in the summer of 1866 the Fenians invaded
Canada and encountered the Canadian militia at
Ridgeway, considerable alarm was felt all along the
frontier. Cornwall, Prescott, Brockville and Kingston
were strengthened with bodies of militia as
being probable points of invasion.</p>

<p>For a time the Government took possession of the
telegraph lines until all danger had passed.</p>

<p>Telegraph offices were kept open day and night
by orders from Ottawa; this continued in force for
several weeks. I was then at Brockville and found
the long hours very irksome. No one believed in
the likelihood of an attack here, but one night this
belief was rather disturbed when a communication
was received by the officer in command warning
him to be on the alert as a body of Fenians had
seized a steamer at Clayton, on the American side
of the river, with the probability of attacking Brockville
or Prescott.</p>

<p>Very soon the sound of the bugle was heard and
the men formed in readiness to meet the enemy.
They had been drilling for several weeks and were
in splendid fighting trim, and under the command of
an experienced officer, Lieutenant-Colonel Atcherley,
D.A.G., who had seen service in the Crimea and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_161">161</a></span>
India, in whom officers and men had the utmost
confidence. A home guard was hastily organized
to watch the river front and give timely notice
should any suspicious craft appear. During the
prevailing excitement some one rang the town alarm
bell, when the citizens were aroused from their beds,
and the streets were soon crowded with men, women
and children eager to learn what was the cause of
the alarm. Many amusing scenes were witnessed.
A few timid souls procured teams, loaded them with
household effects, and with their families started for
safer quarters in the back country. Many old
veterans of the Canadian rebellion were seen carrying
weapons of defense, but appeared more likely to
be offensive only to themselves.</p>

<p>One aged gentleman carried a sword with a rope
in lieu of belt and minus the scabbard; he refused to
waste time looking for such appendages at such a
time; the naked sword was good enough for him.
The night was dark and ominous; every one awaited
coming events with anxiety and more or less nervousness,
and dawn began to appear, but no signs of
the enemy. Meanwhile some of the home guard
got tired waiting for the Fenians, who declined to
come, and they one by one segregated to enjoy the
comforts of their own firesides or seek repose on
their downy beds at home. In this action the officer
commanding the home guard preceded his men and
was the first to retire, but one of their number a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_162">162</a></span>
sturdy Scot, having been placed on an eminence favorable
to scan the movements of the craft on the river,
he held on to his post, however. His family hunted
him up and had much difficulty on prevailing upon
him to come home.</p>

<p>The only fatality that occurred was the death of
an old lady, who, nearing the end, collapsed suddenly
when hearing the alarm bell and told the
reason for its being rung.</p>

<p>Shortly after the Fenian fiasco became a thing of
the past.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_163">163</a></span></p>

<h4><i>Professor Morse’s Valedictory Message.</i></h4>

<p>In 1870, when Mr. Morse had entered his eightieth
year, it was felt by many telegraph men that
some fitting recognition should be paid to the
illustrious inventor before the close of his valuable
life, which was now nearing the end.</p>

<p>In accordance with this general feeling action was
taken and a committee formed, when after much
thought had been given to the subject, it was at last
decided the most appropriate memorial in its
opinion would be to erect a statue and place it in
Central Park, New York. This suggestion had the
general approval of the telegraph fraternity. To
carry this out subscriptions were invited; one of the
first to contribute to the fund was Mr. John Horn,
of Montreal, then in New York, and to complete
the sum required Sir Hugh Allan was appealed to
and promptly sent the desired amount.</p>

<p>The ceremony of unveiling the statue took place
on June 10, 1871. Representative telegraph men
from every State and territory, as well as the
Dominion of Canada, were present, including many
civic and State officials, and addresses were delivered
by Governor Hoffman, Mayor Hall, the venerable
poet, William Cullen Bryant and others.</p>

<p>In the evening a public reception of the delegates<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_164">164</a></span>
was held at the Academy of Music, which was filled
to overflowing, the Hon. William Orton, President of
the Western Union, presiding, by whom the delegates
were cordially welcomed. On the platform was a
table and a set of telegraph instruments connected
with the main office of the Western Union Company.
Punctually at 9 p.m., as previously arranged, Professor
Morse, who was present, indited the following
valedictory:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“Greeting and thanks to the telegraph fraternity
throughout the world. Glory to God in the highest,
on earth peace and good-will to men.”</p>

<p class="sigright">
<span class="smcap">S.&nbsp;F.&nbsp;B. Morse.</span>
</p></blockquote>

<p>The message was sent over the wires by a young
lady operator and Mr. Morse transmitted the signature.</p>

<p>The writer was at Brockville, Ont., at the time
and received this now historic message simultaneously
with hundreds, perhaps thousands of others.</p>

<p>Mr. Morse did not long survive this dramatic
event. It was his last public appearance but one
previous to his death.</p>

<div id="ip_165" class="figcenter" style="width: 378px;"><img src="images/i_165.jpg" width="378" height="600" alt="" /><div class="caption">O. S. WOOD.</div></div>

<h4><i>O. S. Wood, Esq.</i></h4>

<p>One of the most notable telegraph men in America,
the first pupil of Professor Morse and the first to inaugurate
an electric telegraph system in Canada on
an extensive scale.</p>

<p>Born in 1817, near Ithaca, N.Y., after a grammar
school and collegiate course, he studied and became
a civil engineer, and was for some time employed in
that capacity by the New York State Government.</p>

<p>When Mr. Morse was exhibiting his telegraph at
Washington, in 1844, Mr. Wood was induced to
join the inventor, and became his associate in constructing
and working the experimental line between
Washington and Baltimore, and the first to operate
the line when opened for public business and afterwards
engaged in constructing telegraph lines in
other directions.</p>

<p>Early in 1847, when the Montreal Telegraph
Company was formed, his services were sought, and
he was appointed its first General Manager. By the
end of this year a telegraph line was in operation
between Montreal and Toronto, and to Quebec the
following year, and in time extended throughout
the whole country.</p>

<p>Owing to Mr. Wood’s able administration the
Company became one of the most important institutions
in Canada.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_166">166</a></span>
After a long and successful career Mr. Wood retired
in 1865, carrying with him the good will of the
public and the respect and esteem of the directors
and employees of the Company.</p>

<p>He subsequently engaged in other telegraphic
enterprises in the United States, in all of which he
was equally fortunate.</p>

<p>After amassing a considerable fortune he retired
from active business pursuits many years ago, and is
now spending the evening of his days at a quiet
suburb of New York.</p>

<p>He is a man of commanding presence, tall,
dignified and face bearing a very striking resemblance
to Washington.</p>

<p>He possesses a highly cultured mind, a humane
and benevolent disposition, coupled with an agreeable
and attractive manner.</p>

<p>He is, and was always, a patriotic American citizen.
During his sojourn in Canada he never relinquished
his birthright.</p>

<p>The name of Orrin S. Wood will be long
remembered by telegraph men as the first telegraphist
on the continent of America, a distinction worthy
of record in the annals of telegraphy, and is the
oldest telegraph man living at the present time in
America.</p>

<p>Long may he be spared is the fervent hope of the
telegraph fraternity.</p>

<div id="ip_167" class="figcenter" style="width: 381px;"><img src="images/i_167.jpg" width="381" height="600" alt="" /><div class="caption">SIR HUGH ALLAN.</div></div>

<h4><i>Sir Hugh Allan.</i></h4>

<p>The name of this gentleman will be remembered
in connection with the Montreal Telegraph Company.
He was its President from 1851 until the
day of his death.</p>

<p>It was largely through his efforts in conjunction
with Mr. Wood that the telegraph system was extended
to the most remote points in Canada.</p>

<p>It may not be generally known that, although a
very busy man, he acquired a knowledge of telegraphy
and became an expert telegraphist.</p>

<p>He had a private wire erected from his palatial
residence, Ravenscrag, and connected with the
general telegraph office, and by this means kept in
constant touch with the inward and outward movements
of his large steamship fleet.</p>

<p>He was for many years a director of the Western
Union Telegraph Company, and one of the early
contributors to the first Atlantic cable, and for a time
one of its directors, but Sir Hugh Allan will be
better known as the originator of the Montreal
Ocean Steamship Company (now known as the
Allan Line.)</p>

<p>There was no limit to his superabundant energy;
no important enterprise was thought of unless his
name and influence was sought. He was president<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_168">168</a></span>
or director in nearly every financial or industrial
company in Montreal. No one before or since has
occupied such a commanding position in business
life in Canada.</p>

<p>He received the honor of knighthood from the
late Queen personally in recognition of his great
public services; this honor was never more worthily
bestowed.</p>

<p>Sir Hugh Allan was a native of Scotland, born at
Saltcoats, Ayrshire, Sept. 29, 1810. His death took
place in Edinburgh while there on a visit Dec. 9,
1882.</p>

<p>The wonder is that some enduring mark of public
appreciation has not been formulated to perpetuate
the name of one who has done so much for the land
of his adoption.</p>

<p>A statue on Dominion Square would be a fitting
momento.</p>

<h4><i>James Dakers, Esq.</i></h4>

<p>Born in Forfar, Scotland, in 1811, on completing
his studies at the parochial school, he served his
apprenticeship in an attorney’s office in his native
town, and came to Canada in 1840.</p>

<p>He entered the service of the Montreal Telegraph
Company shortly after its organization as Secretary.
When Mr. Wood separated from the Company in
1865, Mr. Dakers was appointed Manager of the
Eastern division, acting as Secretary in addition.
Owing to his faithful and energetic services the
success of the company was greatly enhanced.</p>

<p>“Whatever thy hand findeth to do, do it with all
thy might,” seemed to be his guiding principle. Like
the restless sea, always moving, if not engaged at
his own special work, he would repair to the operating
department and give a helping hand, here and
there, where most needed, then to the receiving
counter attending to customers.</p>

<p>In the early telegraph days during a pressure of
business, he not infrequently would take a handful
of messages and deliver on his way to meals, and
kept a vigilant eye on every department of the
company’s operations.</p>

<p>When the Montreal Telegraph Company leased
its business to the Great North Western Company,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_170">170</a></span>
in 1881, he was not in accord with the directors in
this move, and resigned, retaining, however, the good
will of the shareholders, many of whom shared his
views, and the respect of the business community
by whom he was long and favourably known.</p>

<p>The following tribute to his worth by the late
Rev. Dr. Ormiston in a letter to a friend is deserving
a place here:</p>

<p>“James Dakers is in many respects a remarkable
man. Notwithstanding many disadvantages, he has
fairly earned the high position of influence, independence
and usefulness which he now occupies.
He is characterized by indomitable energy, great
force of character, unyielding tenacity of purpose,
his intellect is of a high order, and eminently practical,
inflexibly upright in all his dealings, conscientiously
faithful to all his obligations, punctual
and thorough in the performance of all his duties,
incapable of meanness, his word as good as his
bond, he is a man universally trusted; his sympathies
with the suffering and the struggling are wide and
tender.</p>

<p>“Many bless him for his wise counsels and efficient
aid; the extent and genuineness of his Christian
charity is as manifest as the steadfastness of his
religious life; as a true friend, he is one among a
thousand.</p>

<p>“Were I asked by a young man for a model of a
man, earnest and indefatigable, pure and firm in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_171">171</a></span>
principle, exemplary and consistent in character,
desirable and valuable in friendship, I would not
hesitate to point him to James Dakers, of Montreal.”</p>

<p>This was a very high testimonial of the character
of Mr. Dakers by one who knew him intimately for
many years.</p>

<p>After giving up his connection with telegraph
interests, with which he had been so long associated,
he lived in retirement until his death, which occurred
on April 15, 1887.</p>

<p>For the long period of fifty-six years Mr. Dwight
has been continuously engaged in the telegraph
service, and only quite recently retired from the
more active duties of his calling.</p>

<p>Born on December 23, 1828, at Belleville, Jefferson
County, N.Y., he entered the service of the
Montreal Telegraph Company in 1847, the year of
its organization, and placed in charge of the Belleville,
Ontario, Office, where he remained for a time,
and afterwards employed at the Head Office,
Montreal. When the wires connected Toronto he
was appointed agent there and soon made superintendent
of the Western Section. In 1881, when
the Montreal Telegraph Company leased its business
to the Great North Western Telegraph Company he
was appointed general manager of the latter.</p>

<p>When Mr. Wiman resigned the presidency of that
company, Mr. Dwight succeeded him and filled the
dual positions until a few months ago, when he
resigned the general managership, the duties being
too onerous and exacting for one at his time of life.</p>

<p>Mr. Dwight is associated with many other enterprises.
He is president of the Canadian General
Electric Company and a director of the Toronto
and London Electric Company, president of Birkbeck<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_173">173</a></span>
Investment Company and chairman of the
Governors of the Royal Humane Society. He is a
man of fine physique, has lived a regular and careful
life, which accounts for the vigorous and evergreen
appearance at his time of life.</p>

<p>He is a keen sportsman and a devoted disciple of
Isaac Walton. Every year he finds time to spend a
few weeks in the happy summer-time, in the wilds
of Northern Ontario, in quest of the speckled beauties
of that region, or in the lower St. Lawrence,
seeking the haunts of the lordly salmon in the
Restigouche or other famous streams. In closing we
wish him long life and many years to indulge in this
his favorite recreation.</p>

<h4><i>William Cassils, Esq.</i></h4>

<p>Born in the village of Renton, Dunbartonshire,
on June 25, 1832, after acquiring a rudimentary
training in the parochial school, and equipped for a
business career, he engaged in a commercial house
for a time, but his prospects were not equal to his
youthful ambition, and his attention was directed to
Canada wherein he had relatives and was encouraged
to join them. He arrived at Montreal in 1852.
Shortly after his arrival he entered the service of the
Montreal Telegraph Company; his abilities were
soon recognized&mdash;within a short time he was appointed
manager of the Quebec Office, the second
in importance to Montreal, and later was made
superintendent of the Eastern Division; while in
this position he had the wires extended to Father
Point, the extreme eastern limit of the Company’s
system at that time.</p>

<p>In 1865 he left the telegraph service to engage in
a wholesale business in Montreal, but his heart was
never quite divorced from his first calling.</p>

<p>In 1876 he organized the Canadian District Telegraph
Company and became its president.</p>

<p>When the telephone first made its appearance
he foresaw its great possibilities, when he, in association
with others, established in 1878 the first telephone<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_175">175</a></span>
exchange in Canada, which was afterwards
merged with the Bell Telephone System.</p>

<p>He was a Director of the Montreal Telephone
Company, President of the Canada Central Railway
and administrator of the St. Lawrence and
Ottawa Railway, both of which are now linked to
the Canadian Pacific Railway; he was also President
of the Dominion Transport Company, but his interest
and sympathies were always keenly directed
to the progress and development of telegraphy. He
himself was an expert telegraphist and always took
a lively interest in the welfare and success of the
telegraph fraternity. He was amiable in manner,
kind in disposition and generous to a fault; his purse
was ever open to the needy or unfortunate.</p>

<p>He possessed a fine tenor voice in his young days.
When at social gatherings he rendered the songs of
his native land with a sweetness and pathos few
could equal. He took a great interest in young men,
and many were indebted to him for advice and
assistance in beginning the battle of life.</p>

<p>He passed away at a comparatively early age (in
his fifty-ninth year) on December 25, 1891.</p>

<h4><i>James Poustie, Esq.</i></h4>

<p>Born at Montrose, Scotland, in 1830. While yet
an infant, his parents came to Canada in the historic
brig “Favorite,” owned and commanded by the
father of the late Sir Hugh Allan.</p>

<p>Mr. Poustie is the pioneer telegraph line builder
of Canada. He was engaged by the Montreal
Telegraph Company shortly after its organization.</p>

<p>After the contractors had finished the line between
Montreal and Toronto, all line extensions
thereafter were under his personal supervision.</p>

<p>He would start early in the spring with gangs of
linemen, equipped with tools and provisions, live
under canvas during the building season and return
in the fall to prepare for the next year’s operations.
This continued on from one year to another
until the whole country was covered with a network
of wires.</p>

<p>In purchasing material Mr. Poustie was a shrewd
and careful buyer, getting the very best to be had at
the lowest figure. In hiring labor, while paying
liberal wages, he took good care to receive in return
a fair day’s work for a fair day’s wage from his men.
Though stern and exacting, he was not unkind. His
gangs of men were chiefly French Canadians; he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_177">177</a></span>
knew their language and could apply it forcibly, if
not elegantly, when circumstances required it.</p>

<p>His men were devoted to him and worked like
beavers. It is no exaggeration to say that owing to
inherent shrewdness in handling his men and purchasing
supplies the lines were constructed at half
the cost of similar work in the United States; this
fact the Company soon became cognizant of.</p>

<p>Finally the system became so extensive as to demand
a division of labor and responsibility when
foremen were placed in charge of important sections
of the line, and Mr. Poustie directed operations from
headquarters at Montreal and became General
Superintendent of Construction.</p>

<p>This position he held for many years. At length
he resigned to rest for a while. He is at present
associated with R.&nbsp;G. Reid &amp; Co., of Newfoundland,
in their Montreal office.</p>

<p>Mr. Poustie is a man liberally endowed with good
common sense, dislikes humbug or insincerity, a keen
observer of men and possesses a retentive memory
and a happy vein of dry caustic humor with a merry
twinkle in his clear penetrating greyish blue eyes.
He can relate many interesting tales generally, from
a humorous point of view, in reference to his own
varied experience, all of which are well worth listening
to. He is still vigorous and hearty, and we hope
has many years before him. Like Yorick, “A man
of infinite jest, of most excellent fancy.”</p>

<h4><i>Charles R. Hosmer, Esq.</i></h4>

<p>“Some are born great. Some achieve greatness.
Some have greatness thrust upon them.” It is no
difficult task to determine to which class Mr. Hosmer
belongs.</p>

<p>Born some fifty years ago in the little French
Canadian village, Coteau Landing. On receiving an
elementary training at the village school he turned
his attention to telegraphy, and, instructed in its
mysteries by the operator and agent at the railway
station there, qualifying as an operator he secured a
position with the Montreal Telegraph Company and
was in its employ for some years.</p>

<p>When the Dominion Telegraph Company came
into being he entered the service and rose step by
step to the highest position attainable. When that
Company merged with the Great North Western, Mr.
Hosmer was offered and accepted the offices of
President and General Manager of the Canada Mutual
Telegraph Company, then recently organized. A
few years later when the Canadian Pacific Railway
Company were about to establish a commercial telegraph
business, he was made General Manager, and
held this for some thirteen or fourteen years, during
which period he was very successful in organizing
and carrying on this branch of the Company’s business.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_179">179</a></span>
He was also a leading factor in exploiting the
Commercial Cable and the Postal Telegraph Cable
Companies; he is a Vice-President of the former and
a director of the Canadian Pacific Railway, director
of the Merchants’ Bank and many other financial
concerns; President of the Ogilvie Milling Company,
said to be the largest of the kind existing; a member
of St. James’ Club and at one time President;
he is also a member of Mount Royal (yclept the
millionaires’ club).</p>

<p>Mr. Hosmer is a recognized leader in financial
circles in Montreal; he is possessed of a cheery,
bright and winning personality, affects no airs,
gracious in manner with a pleasant word for all.</p>

<p>Although not actively connected with the Canadian
Pacific Telegraph System, his guiding hand is
always reached.</p>

<p>He is yet a young man, full of life and energy,
there is no saying the number and kind of activities
may further engage his busy and restless mind.</p>

<p>His motto seems to be:</p>

<h4><i>Hon. George Albertus Cox.</i></h4>

<p>Born at Colborne, Ont., May 7, 1840, he commenced
business life there as an operator in the service
of the Montreal Telegraph Company.</p>

<p>After two years spent in the office of his native
town he was in May, 1858, placed in charge of the
Peterboro office of the Company and in addition a
few years later was made agent of the Canadian Express
Company.</p>

<p>He took an active part in the municipal, educational
and commercial interests of the town and was
for seven years its mayor.</p>

<p>In 1888 he left Peterboro, and from that time has
resided in Toronto where there is a wider scope for
his energies.</p>

<p>He was appointed to the Senate in 1896 by Lord
Aberdeen.</p>

<p>Mr. Cox is a strong temperance man and a warm
supporter of the Methodist Church, of which he is a
member; is Bursar of Victoria University and
President of the Ladies’ College, Whitby; President
of the Bank of Commerce, the Canada Life Insurance
Company, the Western Fire Insurance and on
the directorate of many other companies; is one of
the leading financiers in the Dominion.</p>

<p>His name has been publicly mentioned as one<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_181">181</a></span>
likely to receive honors at the hands of the King at
no distant date. As “coming events cast their shadows
before,” this is not at all improbable.</p>

<p>Senator Cox was one of a syndicate to build the
Canadian Pacific Railway in opposition to the
syndicate formed at Montreal. His name is now
prominently connected with the Grand Trunk
Pacific project.</p>

<p>His success in life has been phenomenal when his
humble beginning is considered, and is a tolerably
fair model for young Canadians to imitate in the
battle of life.</p>

<h4><i>Sir William Cornelius Van Horne.</i></h4>

<p>Born near Joliette, Ill., February 3, 1843. On
quitting school he began life as an office boy at the
Railway Station there, and later became telegraph
operator on the Illinois Central Railway. He was
afterwards despatcher then superintendent of telegraph,
and in a short time was made divisional
superintendent of the Chicago and Alton Railway,
and in 1872 general superintendent of the St. Louis
and Kansas City and Northern Railway; from
there he went, in 1874, to the Southern Minnesota
Railway as its general manager.</p>

<p>In 1878 he returned to the Chicago and Alton
Railway as general superintendent, but two years
later he was called to the position of general superintendent
of the Chicago, Milwaukee and St. Paul
Railway, and in 1881 he was asked to take control
of the Canadian Pacific Railway, then in process
of construction. Under his vigorous and energetic
direction the line was built in one-half of the time
required by the contract between the government
and the Company.</p>

<p>He has been successively Vice-President and
President of the Company and is now Chairman of
the Board of Directors.</p>

<p>The construction and successful management for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_183">183</a></span>
years of this great enterprise has not impaired his
wonderful energies. He has built a railway in the
Island of Cuba some four hundred miles in length in
the usual expeditious manner. This work being
completed, he is now, it is said, turning his attention
to the distant Philippines in order to provide Railway
facilities for the people of that country.</p>

<p>He is a director of many companies, including the
Postal Telegraph and Commercial Cable Company,
and a member of St. James and Mount Royal Clubs.</p>

<p>Sir William Van Horne is not only a famous railway
man, but possesses artistic talents of a high order.
Had he followed art as a profession he would have
taken high rank. He is looked upon as one of the
best art connoisseurs in Canada.</p>

<p>He was created a K.&nbsp;C.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;G. by the late Queen
in acknowledgment of his public services in connection
with the Great Transcontinental Railway and
Imperial Highway.</p>

<h4><i>Andrew Carnegie.</i></h4>

<p>Born in the ancient Royal Burgh Dumfermline,
Fifeshire, in 1837. His father and mother emigrated
to the United States in 1848, settling in Alleghany,
Pa.</p>

<p>The senior Carnegie was a master weaver and a
man of exceptional intelligence, who was obliged to
relinquish his business owing to the development of
steam mills with which the handicraftsmen could not
hope to compete.</p>

<p>At the age of fourteen young Carnegie began work
as a messenger in the office of the Ohio telegraph
company; in a short time he became an operator.</p>

<p>When the Pennsylvania Railway was carried to
Pittsburgh he received an appointment as train despatcher
and rose to be superintendent of the Pittsburgh
division of the system.</p>

<p>At the outbreak of the American civil war Carnegie
was made Superintendent of military roads.</p>

<p>After the war he went into numerous ventures, in
all of which he was eminently successful.</p>

<p>His first big manufacturing venture was the organization
of the Keystone Bridge Company. Iron bridges
were coming into fashion, and he got the lead everywhere.
He soon acquired other manufacturing plants
in the iron line.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_185">185</a></span>
By 1888 he had control of the Homestead Steel
Works and many other plants which were capitalized
at about one hundred million dollars.</p>

<p>Some ten or fifteen years ago Mr. Carnegie began
to feel the oppression of wealth and its responsibilities
and made arrangements by which his employees
became sharers in his profits. After getting free of the
greater part of the personal care of the properties in
which he was the chief owner, Mr. Carnegie has
devoted himself largely to philanthropic objects, his
gifts being chiefly in the line of building public
libraries.</p>

<p>He takes a warm interest in everything relating
to telegraphy and telegraph men, and is rather
pleased to be remembered as an old-time telegraphist.</p>

<p>His chief place of residence is Skibo Castle, Scotland,
but he pays frequent visits to the United
States.</p>

<h4><i>Sir Sandford Fleming, C.E., LL.D.</i></h4>

<p>Was born at Kircaldy, Fifeshire, Scotland, on the
7th day of January, 1827. He left school at the
age of 14, and was immediately articled as a student
of surveying and engineering. At the age of 18
he came to Canada.</p>

<p>In 1852 he was appointed one of the engineering
staff of the Northern Railway then known as the
Ontario and Lake Huron road.</p>

<p>In 1863 he went to England as a representative
of the Red River settlement to invoke the aid of the
Imperial Government toward the construction of a
railway to connect with the Canadian railways, but
the scheme was not carried out.</p>

<p>When the Intercolonial Railway was projected he
was made Chief of Surveys and Construction. When
nearing its completion he was called upon by the
Government to undertake the survey of the proposed
route to the Pacific.</p>

<p>After exhaustive surveys had been made and the
construction of the Canadian Pacific had been well
advanced and some six or eight hundred miles of
the heaviest sections built, political exigencies arose,
and in 1880 he resigned. In that year he was
elected Chancellor of Queen’s University, and in
1882, while on a visit to Scotland, was presented<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_187">187</a></span>
with the freedom of Kircaldy Burghs, and in 1884
received the honorary degree of LL.D., from St.
Andrew’s University.</p>

<p>In 1881 he went as a delegate from the Canadian
Institute and the American Meteorological Society
to the International Geographical Congress at
Venice, and in 1884 he was appointed a delegate
of Great Britain to represent the Dominion of Canada
at the International Prime Meridian Conference at
Washington, where he had the pleasure of finding
his views which he had been pressing on the public
for years with regard to Cosmic time and a prime
meridian for all nations, accepted by the representatives
of the civilized world.</p>

<p>As early as 1879 Sir Sandford submitted to the
Canadian Government a scheme for spanning the
Pacific Ocean by electric cables which would, in
connection with existing land and cable wires, complete
the electric girdle of the globe, and bring
Great Britain, Canada, Australia and New Zealand
in unbroken electric touch with each other without
passing over foreign territory. The proposition was
given due consideration and the subject was laid
before successive parliaments, but, while much interest
had been awakened, nothing practical was
accomplished, owing to the many obstacles in the
way, and the matter was, for a time, held in abeyance.
Meanwhile its energetic projector did not
despair. Year after year he took every favorable<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_188">188</a></span>
opportunity to bring it before the public men of
Great Britain and the Colonies, travelling thousands
of miles to attend Conferences at London, Brisbane,
Ottawa and elsewhere, wherever the subject was
under review. At length the reasons and arguments
adduced on all these occasions in support of
this scheme were found to be convincing, and its
feasibility so apparent that it was finally accepted
and practically applied.</p>

<p>On the 31st day of December, 1900, the Imperial
and five Colonial governments joined in an interstate
partnership to carry out the work so long and
ably advocated by its originator and promoter.
Exactly twenty-two months after the agreement,
8,272 miles of cable had been manufactured and
safely embedded in the vast depths of the Pacific,
nearly a third of the earth’s circumference, on the 31st
day of October, 1902, electric communication was
successfully established between Canada, New Zealand,
Fiji and Australia, and has been uninterruptedly
maintained ever since. The success of this great
telegraph enterprise, the most stupendous ever taken,
was a fitting prelude to the dawn of the new century
and a splendid triumph to the genius and foresight
of Sir Sandford Fleming.</p>

<p>During nearly a quarter of a century he had given
his time and talents, as well as his private means, to
accomplish the end he had in view, and it must have<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_189">189</a></span>
been peculiarly gratifying to him that his labors all
these years had not been in vain. His patriotic and
self-sacrificing efforts should receive some suitable
public acknowledgment in some substantial form.</p>

<p>In 1877 he was made a Companion of St. Michael
and St. George, and in 1897 he was promoted to be
a commander of the same distinguished order on the
occasion of the sixtieth year of Her Majesty’s reign.</p>

<h4><i>Frederick N. Gisborne</i></h4>

<p>Was born at Broughton, Lancashire, England,
March 8, 1824, and came to Canada in 1845.</p>

<p>When the Montreal Company was organized he
was employed as one of its first operators, opening
the first office of the Company at Quebec.</p>

<p>He was afterwards engaged in various telegraph
enterprises in the Maritime Provinces.</p>

<p>In 1851 he laid the cable connecting New Brunswick
and Prince Edward Island, the first submarine
cable in America.</p>

<p>In 1856 he laid the cable connecting Cape Breton
and Newfoundland (85 miles in length), this being an
important link in the Atlantic cable system.</p>

<p>Previous to this he had secured a charter from the
Newfoundland Government to construct a telegraph
line across the Island, which, with the projected cable
crossing the Gulf of St. Lawrence connecting with
the land telegraphs, would provide the quickest news
on the arrival of steamers from Europe. In this project
he was associated with several American capitalists,
but financial difficulties arose, and in the winter
of 1853&ndash;4 Mr. Gisborne visited New York to secure
further capital, and there met Mr. Cyrus W. Field,
with the result that Mr. Field returned with him to
Newfoundland. The Legislature, at Mr. Gisborne’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_191">191</a></span>
request, cancelled the original thirty years’ charter
granted to himself and associates, for a new charter
for a term of fifty years to the New York, Newfoundland
and London Company. The object of
this Company was to complete the land lines begun
by Gisborne, lay the cable in the Gulf of St. Lawrence
and to lay a cable across the Atlantic. The
latter attempt, however, proved a failure, and the
franchise of this Company was subsequently acquired
by the Anglo-American Telegraph and Cable
Company.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Mr. Gisborne dropped out of the enterprise,
probably losing all the interest in it he
possessed. Some years later he was appointed
Superintendent of the Canadian Government Telegraph
and Signal Service, which he filled until his
death, which occurred on Aug. 30, 1892.</p>

<h4><i>Thomas A. Edison.</i></h4>

<p>Born in Milan, Erie county, Ohio, February 11,
1847, he attended school for a few months only,
being educated at home by his mother, a woman of
superior ability and attainments.</p>

<p>The boy was an apt scholar, showing preference
for historical and scientific subjects.</p>

<p>In 1854 his father removed to Port Huron, Mich.,
where, at the age of twelve, he was engaged as a
newsboy on the Grand Trunk Railway. While thus
employed he took every occasion to watch the operations
of the telegraph at the various stations on the
line. He erected a wire between his father’s house and
that of a neighbour, himself making the instruments to
save the cost of battery material; he experimented
with a tom-cat, using the fore and hind feet as electrodes.
The connections having been duly made
he tried to start an induced current by rubbing the
back of the feline. This amusing experiment was
not a success, however, and was abandoned; later on
he was rewarded for bravery in rescuing the child
of the station master from the front of a moving
train by receiving lessons in telegraphy, which he
soon mastered, and was employed as telegraph
operator on the Grand Trunk Railway for a time,
leaving thereafter for the United States, where he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_193">193</a></span>
worked in various cities, meanwhile devoting
himself to the study of electrical science then little
understood in America.</p>

<p>While working as operator in New Orleans, La.,
he invented the automatic repeater. In 1864 he
conceived the idea, which he afterwards perfected,
of duplex telegraphy, but it was not put into practical
operation until 1872. His next important inventions
were the quadruplex and the printing telegraph
for stock quotations.</p>

<p>In time his inventions were numerous and varied.
On the lists of inventions at the patent office, Washington,
in 1895, no less than 600 were credited to
his name. The most notable amongst these are the
quadruplex, the phonograph and the incandescent
light.</p>

<p>Although Edison had acquired considerable wealth,
yet in 1896 he publicly declared that he would have
been at least $600,000 better off if he had never
taken out a patent or defended one, and that all the
money he ever made was made by manufacturing
his inventions or in their practical use.</p>

<p>In 1896 he established the village of Edison, N.&nbsp;J.,
in the very centre of an iron ore deposit, a plant for
the magnetic separation of iron from the rock in
which it is embedded in the mine, the process being
purely automatic. He first invented a crusher capable
of reducing ten tons of rock to dust every minute;
he then invented apparatus whereby the iron ore<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_194">194</a></span>
was separated from the dust by means of a magnet,
the extracted ore being made into briquettes and
easily handled for transport to the blast furnace.</p>

<p>Mr. Edison is one of the simplest and unostentatious
of men, careless in his costume, abstemious and
simple in his habits, unselfish and generous in dispositions.</p>

<p>He married in 1874, and has four sons and one
daughter.</p>

<h4><i>Isaac D. Purkis, Esq.</i></h4>

<p>Was born in Laprairie, Que., in 1827. He was
son of the Rev. Isaac Purkis, who came from England
in 1821, and was a lineal descendant of the
Purkis who carried the body of King William Rufus
from the New Forest to Winchester in Hampshire,
when shot by Sir Walter Tyrell, while hunting in the
New Forest.</p>

<p>Mr. Purkis learned telegraphy under Mr. O.&nbsp;S.
Wood and was located at Prescott, Ont., from 1849
to 1851, in the employ of the Montreal Telegraph
Company. In 1851, on the very flattering recommendation
of Mr. Wood, he entered the service of
the British North American Telegraph Association
and was appointed Superintendent (equivalent to
General Manager at the present date). This company
had a line from Quebec city east, to Rivière du
Loup, thence southerly to St. John, N.B., etc. In
1853, on the recommendation of Mr. Purkis, the line
was extended to Montreal, along the north shore of
the river, and thus entered into competition with the
Montreal Telegraph Company, whose line was from
Point Levi, along the south shore to Montreal and
thence westward. Connection was first made between
Quebec and Point Levi by a long span of
wire on masts, in the spring when the ice was breaking<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_196">196</a></span>
up. None of the linemen would attempt to
cross on the floating, broken ice. Mr. Purkis then
got a ladder, and placing himself in the centre with
the coil of wire over his shoulder succeeded in making
the passage, at the same time paying out the
wire over the edges of the ice. His exertions were
so great that he was completely exhausted when he
finally got across.</p>

<p>This company established at Rivière du Loup,
Que., a signal office under the Lloyd code, whereby
all vessels passing were signalled and information at
once telegraphed to the owner or agent and to the
press. In addition to this a boat manned with capable
oarsmen, swivel gun on bow to signal the approaching
steamer, more particularly at night, was
used to intercept and receive from the inward
steamer the despatches and latest newspapers from
Europe. The method was to throw a tin cylinder in
which were enclosed the despatches and newspapers
with a small flag attached to the end; this was
attached to a lanyard, and when secured by the
Telegraph boat, the steamer was given a signal and
she proceeded on her way, the despatches being
promptly brought ashore and delivered to the telegraph
and signal officer in charge.</p>

<p>In December 29, 1854, the British North American
Telegraph Association and the Canada Grand
Trunk Telegraph Company (whose lines extended
from Montreal westward) entered into an agreement<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_197">197</a></span>
for the mutual interchange of business, and Mr.
Purkis was appointed Superintendent of both companies.
This position he held until both companies
were amalgamated with the Montreal Telegraph
Company in the latter part of 1856. When he left
the telegraph business in August of that year his
subordinates presented him with a signet ring, which
he wore to the day of his death.</p>

<p>He engaged in the forwarding and ferry business
at Prescott until 1870, when he was appointed
General Manager of the Dominion Telegraph Company,
with headquarters at Toronto. He resigned
from this position in 1874 and again returned to
Prescott taking up his former business. Besides
himself he had three brothers engaged in the telegraph
service, George, Arthur and William, all of
whom predeceased him many years since.</p>

<p>Mr. Purkis was a citizen of the highest type,
always eager for the welfare of the town and its inhabitants.</p>

<p>Personally, he was of a most genial and kindly
disposition, a true and sincere friend to all who
shared his confidence.</p>

<p>He passed away recently at his home at Prescott
after a brief illness, in his 78th year.</p>

<h2><a id="Submarine_Telegraphy"></a><i>Submarine Telegraphy.</i></h2>

<p>When the electric telegraph had been successfully
established in Great Britain, the public soon became
alive to the necessity of extending its operations
beyond the confines of the United Kingdom.</p>

<p>As early as 1840 Professor Charles Wheatstone,
of England, suggested the practicability of connecting
Dover and Calais, in France, by an electric wire,
but it was ten years later before a submarine line
was laid. This first attempt proved a failure, owing
to the wires being imperfectly insulated.</p>

<p>In 1851 a second cable, containing four copper
wires insulated with gutta percha and surrounded by
tarred hemp and protected by ten galvanized iron
wires wound round spirally, was laid connecting
England and France. This proved successful. All
submarine cables thereafter were made on this pattern.</p>

<p>It was now evident that the sea offered no barrier
to international telegraphic communication.</p>

<p>In the same year (1851) a submarine cable ten
miles in length was laid connecting Prince Edward
Island and New Brunswick.</p>

<p>In 1852 six submarine lines were laid connecting
England with Ireland, Scotland and the continent,
the longest of which was one about one hundred<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_199">199</a></span>
nautical miles, and in 1854 five additional cables
were laid in European waters.</p>

<p>In 1856 Newfoundland and Cape Breton was connected
by submarine wire, the distances being some
eighty-five miles. The successful laying of this
cable led to the more gigantic undertaking, viz., to
connecting the old and the new worlds electrically.
There are three names prominently connected with
the origination of the idea, Bishop Mulock, of
Newfoundland, Frederick Gisborne and Cyrus W.
Field.</p>

<p>The following interesting remarks of Mr. Mackay,
of Newfoundland, is worth producing.</p>

<p>In a speech he made at a banquet given by the
old-time Telegraphers’ Association, held at the
Windsor Hotel in the summer of 1901, he said;
“If you please, I shall now refer to a matter that I
think may be far more interesting to you all than
anything I have said thus far. I mean to refer to
the matter of the Atlantic telegraph, as it is a subject
that must always occupy a large share of the attention
of the telegraph world, because at the present
time telegraphing by cable is one of the most important
factors in the whole service that makes the
telegraphy of the world as valuable as it is. The
subject that I wanted to mention to you is the question
as to who was the person that initiated or gave
birth to the idea of an Atlantic telegraph, which, of
course, gave birth to all deep-sea and long-distance
telegraphy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_200">200</a></span>
“As a matter of fact, in Newfoundland, where this
subject has been given considerable attention, it is
stated that the Right Rev. Dr. Mulock, Roman
Catholic Bishop of Newfoundland, was one of the
parties. Others contend that the late F.&nbsp;N. Gisborne
is the person, others that Cyrus W. Field is
the person.</p>

<p>“I would like to refer to those gentlemen,
beginning first with Dr. Mulock.</p>

<p>“I trust you will pardon me for saying that I consider
my opinion on the matter is worth something,
inasmuch as I think I am the only man of those that
were connected with the Atlantic telegraph at the
time of its inception, in an executive capacity, all
the others having gone before, as far as I know.</p>

<p>“Now with regard to Dr. Mulock, I think there is
not the least doubt he got his information from Mr.
Gisborne in regard to the Atlantic telegraph, and
that his only connection with it was the expression
of his belief in the possibility of its establishment,
just as a man might say, for instance, we will in the
next generation fly in the air; but he contributed
nothing towards the direct accomplishment of the
object. There is not the least doubt in my mind,
therefore, that it lies between Mr. F.&nbsp;N. Gisborne
and Cyrus W. Field.</p>

<p>“Mr. Gisborne’s friends contend now that he was
unjustly treated by Field, and that he really had advised
Mr. Field of the possibility of accomplishing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_201">201</a></span>
this great work. Mr. Gisborne did not make this
contention in his lifetime.</p>

<p>“I had the privilege of seeing him some years before
he died, long subsequent to the establishment of the
Atlantic telegraph, and he said that on his meeting
Cyrus W. Field, in the month of January, 1854,
whilst foreshadowing the possibility and the desirability
of establishing Atlantic communication
between Newfoundland and the Continent of
America, he did not refer to the possibility of a
cable to England, but only relied on the success of
that enterprise by contributing to its coffers messages
obtained from steamers arriving in Newfoundland
and transmitted from thence by carrier pigeons,
and ultimately by telegraphic cable.</p>

<p>“Mr. Gisborne made that statement, and he admitted
that he did not, in his first interview with
Cyrus W. Field, foreshadow the possibility of the
Atlantic telegraph.</p>

<p>“Now Mr. Field on being questioned in regard to
that interview which took place in Mr. Field’s
house in January, 1854, said exactly the same thing.</p>

<p>“He only contended for the pigeons in the first
place and the possibility of a cable to Cape Breton
in the second place, and the clever far-seeing commercial
man, as he was considered, said that there was no
possibility of such a scheme ever paying, and, therefore,
he would not have anything to do with it; but
on seeing Gisborne, he turned over the Globe, and, in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_202">202</a></span>
turning it over, seeing that Cape Breton was only
an inch or two on the Globe from Newfoundland,
and that Ireland was only six inches, with his
shrewdness and cleverness he said at once, ‘If a
cable can be laid to Cape Breton, why can’t it be laid
to Ireland?’ and the next morning he wrote a letter
to Professor Morse and asked him if a cable could
be laid to Ireland and whether it could be worked.
He also wrote a letter to Lieutenant Maury, of the
United States Navy, and asked him whether it would
be possible to lay a cable to Ireland. Satisfactory
answers being obtained to these two questions, he at
once embarked in the enterprise and threw his whole
influence (rich man that he was at that time) into
the work of laying the Atlantic cable. You will see,
therefore, that Mr. Gisborne did not communicate
the idea of the Atlantic cable, but he communicated
<em>the idea of a cable</em> that was quite enough for a man
of Cyrus W. Field’s foresight and ingenuity to suggest
the possibility of an Atlantic cable, so that
there is really no difference as to credit due these
two gentlemen for the initiation of the project, and
I can assure you it is most satisfactory to me because
I have always been a warm friend of both
gentlemen (applause). I think I am the only living
witness to these facts I have related, and I am glad
to have this opportunity to state it publicly. I know
it is a matter of interest to all telegraph men. Now
the question comes to my mind, Who then was the
author of the first idea of the Atlantic cable.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_203">203</a></span>
“In this connection I will go back to the year 1850.
In 1854 the New York, Newfoundland and London
Telegraph Company obtained a charter which gave
them exclusive rights to land a cable in Newfoundland
for fifty years. This charter terminates in 1904,
and I hope to live to see that charter expire. I am
confident it will never be renewed, because the British
Government would never consent, now that deep-sea
telegraphy is an assured fact, to exclusive rights,
of that nature being conferred on anybody or corporation.
(Applause.)</p>

<p>“We will now go back to, Who was the first man
that started the idea of the Atlantic cable? and I
find no difficulty in naming the man, as far as my
opinion goes.</p>

<p>“In 1850, whilst studying telegraphy with Mr.
Gisborne in Halifax, he was very communicative in
all his methods and actions, and he showed me letters
at that time from Mr. Brett. There were two
Bretts. I think the first was John and the second
Jacob, but it was the elder Brett who was in communication
with him then by letter, and he had
given birth to the idea of a cable. He not only gave
birth to it in 1850, but in 1852 he laid the cable
from Dover in England to France, and that cable
was working until within a few years of the present
time. He, therefore, not only gave birth to the idea,
but he gave actual presence to the cable, and I think
it is not unlikely, and I find it easy for me to say,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_204">204</a></span>
that there never was an inventor who was wont to
appreciate his own invention. I think it is not unlikely
that Brett, when he had the idea of a cable at
all, although only twenty-one miles in length, that
he had within his vision thousands of miles, covering
all bays, all waters and all seas (applause); that is
my idea that John Brett was the originator and inventor
of the submarine cable.”</p>

<p>Mr. Mackay, whose testimony we have given,
was the superintendent of telegraphs for the Anglo-American
Telegraph and Cable Company for the
Island of Newfoundland and held this position for
many years.</p>

<p>The circumstances which brought Gisborne and
Field together was as follows: The former had
planned a line of telegraph from St. John’s, Nfld.,
through four hundred miles of dense wilderness and
forest to Cape Ray, there to connect by steamers or
by carrier pigeons or by cable.</p>

<p>To enable him to carry out this project the
Legislature of Newfoundland granted £500 for a
survey of the route.</p>

<p>An Act was also passed incorporating the Newfoundland
Telegraph Company with an exclusive
right of way for thirty years, including amongst
other privileges valuable concessions of public lands.
Having thus laid the groundwork of his scheme
Gisborne immediately left for New York to raise
capital; in this he was successful. Horace B.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_205">205</a></span>
Tebbets and D.&nbsp;H. Holbrook were among the more
prominent to join him, and a company was organized
under the charter which had been granted. Soon
after the formation of the Company Mr. Gisborne
left for England, to purchase a submarine cable to
connect Cape Ray and Cape Breton.</p>

<p>In 1852 thirty miles of the land line had been
completed, and Mr. Gisborne had skilfully and successfully
laid the first submarine cable of any considerable
length in America between Cape Ray
and Cape Breton and Cape Tormentine and Cape
Traverse in Northumberland Straits.</p>

<p>In 1853, however, the cable gave out, about the
same time the New York stockholders withheld
their support; this caused the work to be suspended
and the Company became bankrupt. Mr. Gisborne,
finding himself unable to proceed, gave up all he
possessed to pay the accrued debts, and for a time
abandoned the enterprise.</p>

<p>Under such circumstances and with renewed
courage Mr. Gisborne in 1854 returned to New York,
to try, if possible, to resuscitate interest in his work.
Among others to whom he now found access was
Mr. Matthew D. Field, a New York Engineer, to
whom he communicated his position and plans.
Mr. Field, however, declined to interest himself, but
politely offered to introduce him to his brother,
Cyrus W. Field, at that time retired from active
business. This led to several interviews, which had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_206">206</a></span>
the effect of exciting a general interest in telegraph
affairs in Mr. Field’s mind. Standing one evening
over a large globe after one of these interviews with
Mr. Gisborne, and tracing the lines overland to St.
John’s, Nfld., an idea dawned on his mind which
gradually strengthened its hold upon his imagination
and soon absorbed his whole heart and life.</p>

<p>While following with his finger the track of the inland
lines to the ocean, it was natural to traverse
also the course of the steamships across the Northern
Atlantic. It was but a step further to plant his
finger on London and to feel that to reach the centre
of English commercial life by telegraph, were
this practicable, would be an achievement worth
striving for.</p>

<p>Mr. Field, thus aroused to a comprehension of a
possible opportunity to embark in a grand enterprise
worthy of the age, began to make enquiry respecting
the project of laying a cable on the bed of
the Atlantic. He found that a recent survey of the
Northern Atlantic, under the direction of Lieutenant
Maury, had been made, and a plateau extending
from Newfoundland to Ireland had been discovered,
forming a safe and easy pathway for a submarine
wire.</p>

<p>Professor Morse also assured Mr. Field that the
project was entirely feasible, and warmly encouraged
him in it, and asserted the certainty of its ultimate
accomplishment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_207">207</a></span>
Being now thoroughly convinced Mr. Field communicated
with some of his intimate friends, amongst
whom were Peter Cooper, Moses Taylor, Marshall
O. Roberts and Chandler White, names familiar in
the history of American enterprise. The scheme
met with earnest attention and ready response.
Mutual consultations resulted soon after in the
organization of a company with a capital of one
million and a half dollars to carry out the project
and the immediate purchase of the Gisborne charter,
it resulted also in the generous enlargement of the
franchises granted by the colony of Newfoundland,
the exclusive right to land ocean cables during fifty
years, £50,000 to aid the work and fifty square
miles of land when the cable was successfully laid
was granted.</p>

<p>The Government of Prince Edward Island also
made liberal grants of money and land. With
these important arrangements completed on May
6, 1854, a company was formally organized under
the corporate name of the New York, Newfoundland
and London Electric Telegraph Company.</p>

<p>Peter Cooper was elected President.</p>

<p>Chandler White, Vice-President.</p>

<p>Moses Taylor, Treasurer.</p>

<p>Professor Morse, Electrician.</p>

<p>Matthew D. Field, Engineer.</p>

<p>The latter immediately proceeded to Newfoundland
to begin operations, first honorably paying the
debts due to workmen under Mr. Gisborne.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_208">208</a></span>
Mr. Field, with six hundred men, pushed the work
of construction through the vast forests of Newfoundland
until the wires were erected between St.
John’s and Cape Ray. Meanwhile, Cyrus W. Field
made his first voyage to England to contract for a
new cable to connect Newfoundland with Nova
Scotia, and to continue his enquiries into the
scientific obstacles to the laying and operating a
cable between the shores of the Old World and the
New.</p>

<p>In England Mr. Field met Mr. John W. Brett,
the originator and inventor of submarine cables,
who gave every encouragement to Mr. Field in the
Atlantic cable project, and to show his faith in its
success Mr. Brett purchased a considerable number
of shares in the concern.</p>

<p>In 1855 the cable for Cape Ray was shipped from
England. It weighed 400 tons, and was manufactured
by W. Kupert &amp; Co., London. The steamer,
“James Adger,” was chartered by Mr. Field, to convey
a large party to Newfoundland to witness the
submergence.</p>

<p>Among these were Peter Cooper, Robert W.
Lowber, Professor Morse, Rev. H.&nbsp;M. Field, Rev.
Gardiner Spring, Rev. J.&nbsp;M. Sherwood, Dr. James
A. Sayre, Bayard Taylor, Fitzjames O’Brien and
John Mullarky.</p>

<p>The cable had arrived in an English brig, which
had to be towed by the steamer from shore to shore.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_209">209</a></span>
Everything seemed favorable. A hawser was
thrown from the steamer to the brig and the cable
began to find its way to its appointed bed. Unfortunately,
while yet in mid-channel, a furious gale set
in when the overloaded brig became unmanageable,
and, fearing destruction, the cable was cut and the
work for the time abandoned.</p>

<p>In 1856 a steamer amply provided for the purpose
was chartered, by which after lading the cable it
was easily and successfully submerged without a
hitch.</p>

<p>The line was now finished. Although it had to
wait during many years for the completion of the
great work for which it was a link, it ultimately
showed the wisdom of its construction and became
of much value to its projectors; it had cost so far
$1,000,000.</p>

<p>On the formation of the Atlantic Telegraph Company,
the charter of the New York, Newfoundland
and London Telegraph Company, conferring the
exclusive right for fifty years to land cables on the
Island of Newfoundland, was made over to the new
Company.</p>

<p>In 1855 Chandler White died; on his death, Wilson
G. Hunt, a name well-known among merchant
princes of New York, took his place as director,
and gave the company during its existence the
benefit of his able counsel and active and intelligent
support. Mr. Cyrus W. Field was at the same time<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_210">210</a></span>
elected vice-president and Robt. W. Lowder, secretary.</p>

<p>In 1857 the first attempt was made to lay a cable
across the Atlantic, the length of which was 2,500
miles. After paying out 255 miles the cable broke,
and the work was given up for that year.</p>

<p>In 1858 another attempt was made, the British
naval ship “Agamemnon” and the United States
frigate “Niagara,” each carrying one-half of the
cable, proceeded to mid-ocean, spliced the ends, and
going in opposite directions reached Newfoundland
and Ireland the same day, August 5, after each
having successfully accomplished the submergence.
There was great rejoicing on both sides of the Atlantic
over the event, but disappointment soon followed.
On the 1st of September, the cable ceased working
and the project for a time was abandoned. Seven
years after another attempt was made, a new cable
had been prepared and stowed in the hold of the
“Great Eastern.” The big ship, lightly carrying her
great burden, steamed out to sea paying out the cable
as she proceeded. Half the Atlantic was passed over
in safety when the cable broke and the “Great
Eastern” returned to her moorings. Such, however,
had been the indications of success in laying the cable
in 1865, that in 1866 the Anglo-American Telegraph
Company was organized with a new capital, and
the “Great Eastern” once more started across the
deep, when the great work was at last accomplished.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_211">211</a></span>
Universal joy followed the announcement that the
cable was successfully laid, not only so, but the lost
cable of the previous year was, to the general wonder,
found, picked up and spliced and continued to the
American shore.</p>

<p>The cable was thrown open for public traffic
August 26, 1866. A large and remunerative business
followed, which has continued unbroken ever since.</p>

<p>There are now fourteen cables spanning the bed
of the Atlantic between Europe and America, the
total length of these being 40,000 miles.</p>

<p>In the present year (1902) the total length of
submarine cables in the world is about 200,000
miles, all but 20,000 of which are owned by commercial
concerns and the remainder by different
Governments.</p>

<p>The amount of capital invested in cables is estimated
at about $210,000,000.</p>

<p>The cost of the cable before laying depends upon
the dimensions of the cars, or conducting wire, which
is copper; gutta percha, which still forms the only
trustworthy insulating material, constituting the principal
item of expense.</p>

<p>For an Atlantic cable of the most recent construction,
the cost may be taken at £250 to £300 per
nautical mile.</p>

<p>The system of submarine cables originating in
Great Britain has continued to develop in her hands,
until the world has been covered with a veritable network<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_212">212</a></span>
of cables, which has hitherto done much to
prevent the decline of her commercial supremacy.
During the last few years, however, other maritime
nations in Europe have begun to realize the importance
of submarine cable enterprise in this respect,
and France and Germany have made some progress
towards freeing themselves from British monopoly;
both are now connected with America by cables
which are owned in their respective countries, though
their manufacture and submergence was effected by
an English Company.</p>

<p>This spread of the cable system has naturally followed
trade routes, and thus, with the exception of
the cables to America, their trend has been eastwards
as far as Australia and Japan. During the
year 1902 the Dominion of Canada was connected
by cable with New Zealand and Australia, the total
length of cable, 8,272 miles, and cost £1,795,000.</p>

<p>An agreement was entered into between the Imperial
Government and the Governments of Canada,
Victoria, New South Wales, New Zealand and Queensland,
and it was through the persistent efforts and
advocacy of Sir Sandford Fleming that this great
work was accomplished.</p>

<p>Owing to the experience gained with many thousand
miles in all depths and under varying conditions
of weather and climate, the risks, and, consequently,
the cost of laying, has been greatly reduced,
but the cost of effecting a repair still remains<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_213">213</a></span>
a very uncertain quantity, success being dependent
on quiet conditions of sea and weather.</p>

<p>The <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">modus operandi</i> is briefly as follows: The
position of the fracture is determined by electrical
tests from both ends with more or less accuracy depending
on the nature of the fault, but it can be
located within a few miles. The repair steamer, on
reaching the given position, lowers one or perhaps
two mark buoys, mooring them by mushroom
anchors, chain and rope, using these buoys to guide
the direction of tow. Grapnel, a species of five
pronged anchors attached to a strong compound
rope formed of strands of steel and manilla, is lowered
to the bottom and dragged at a slow speed, as it
were ploughing a furrow in the sea-bottom in a line
at right angles to the cable route until the behavior
of the dynamometer shows that the cable is hooked.
The ship is then stopped and the cable gradually
hove up towards the surface; but in deep water,
unless it has been caught near a loose end, the cable
will break on the grapnel before it reaches the surface,
as the catenary strain on the bight will be
greater than it will stand. Another buoy is put down
marking this position, fixing at the same time the
actual line of the cable. Grappling will then be recommenced
so as to hook the cable near enough to the
end to allow of its being hove to the surface.
When this has been done an electrical test is applied,
and, if the original fracture is between the ship<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_214">214</a></span>
and shore, the heaving in of the cable will continue
until the end comes on board. Another buoy is
then lowered to mark the spot, and the cable on the
other side of the fracture grappled for brought to the
surface, and, if communication is found perfect with
the shore, buoyed with sufficient chain and rope
attached to allow of the cable itself reaching the bottom.
The ship now returns to the position of original
attack and by similar operations brings on board the
end which secures communication with the shore.
The gap between the two ends has now been closed
by splicing on new cable and paying out until the
buoyed end is reached, which is then hove up and
brought on board. After the “final splice,” as it is
termed, between these ends has been made, the
bight made fast to a rope is lowered overboard, the
slip rope cut and the cable allowed to sink by its
own weight to its resting place on the sea-bed. The
repairs being thus completed the various mark buoys
are picked up and the ship returns to her usual
station.</p>

<p>The grappling of the cable and raising it to the
surface from a depth of 2,000 fathoms seldom
occupies less than twenty-four hours, and, since any
extra strain due to the pitching of the vessel must
be avoided, it is clear that the state of the sea and
weather is the predominating factor in the time
necessary for effecting the long series of operations
which, under the most favorable circumstances, are<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_215">215</a></span>
required for a repair. In addition the intervention
of heavy weather may mar all the work already
accomplished and require the whole series of operations
to be undertaken <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">de novo</i>.</p>

<p>As to cost, one transatlantic cable repair cost £75,000.</p>

<p>The repair of the Aden Bombay cable, broken in
a depth of 1,900 fathoms, was effected with the expenditure
of 176 miles of new cable, and, after a
lapse of 251 days, 103 being spent in actual work,
which for the remainder of the time was interrupted
by the monsoon. A repair of the Lisbon Porthcarrow
cable broken in the Bay of Biscay in 2,700 fathoms,
eleven years after the cable was laid, took 215 days
with an expenditure of three hundred miles of cable.</p>

<p>All interruptions are not so costly, for in shallow
waters, with favorable conditions of weather, a repair
may be only a matter of a few hours, and it is in
such waters that the majority of breaks occur, but
still a large reserve fund must be laid aside for the
purpose.</p>

<p>As an ordinary instance it has been stated that
the cost of repairing the direct United States cable
up to 1900 from its submergence in 1874 averages
£8,000 per annum.</p>

<p>Nearly all the cable companies possess their own
steamers of sufficient dimensions, and specially
equipped for making ordinary repairs, but for exceptional
cases where a considerable quantity of new<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_216">216</a></span>
cable may have to be inserted, it may be necessary
to charter the service of one of the larger vessels
owned by a cable manufacturing company at a certain
sum per day, which may well reach £200 to £300.</p>

<p>This fleet of cable ships now number forty, ranging
in size from vessels of 300 tons to 10,000 tons’
carrying capacity.</p>

<p>The life of a cable is usually considered to continue
until it is no longer capable of being lifted for repair,
but, in some cases the duration and frequency of interruptions
as affecting public convenience with the
loss of revenue and cost of repairs, must together
decide the question of either making very extensive
renewals or even abandoning the whole cable. It is
a well ascertained fact that the insulator&mdash;gutta
percha&mdash;is, when kept under water, practically imperishable,
so that it is only the original strength of
the sheathing wires and the deterioration allowable
in them that have to be considered.</p>

<p>Cables have frequently been picked up, showing
after many years of submergences, no appreciable deterioration
in this respect, while in other cases ends
have been picked up which in the course of twelve
years had been corroded to needle points, the result,
no doubt, of metalliferous deposits in the locality.</p>

<p>The experience gained in the earlier days of ocean
telegraphy from the failure and abandonment of
nearly 50 per cent. of the deep-sea cables within the
first twelve years, placed the probable life of a cable<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_217">217</a></span>
as low as fifteen years, but the weeding out of unserviceable
types of construction and the general
improvement in materials, have, by degrees, extended
that first estimate until now the limit may be safely
placed at not less than forty years.</p>

<p>In depths beyond the reach of wave motion and
apart from the suspension across a submarine gully
which will sooner or later result in a rupture of the
cable, the most frequent cause of interruption is seismic
or other shifting of the ocean bed, while in shallower
waters and near the shore the dragging of
anchors or fishing trawls have been mostly responsible.</p>

<p>Since by international agreement the wilful damage
of a cable has been constituted a criminal
offence and the cables have avoided crossing the fishing
banks or have adopted the wise policy of refunding
the value of anchors lost on their cables, the
number of such fractures have been greatly diminished.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_218">218</a></span></p>

<h3><i>Cable Instruments.</i></h3>

<p>The apparatus in use on land lines are not
adapted for cables except for comparatively short
distances not exceeding four or five hundred miles.</p>

<p>When the Atlantic cable was laid a special instrument
had to be devised to transmit signals to the
distant end. The man to accomplish this was Professor
Thomson (now Lord Kelvin), who invented
the mirror system. A beam of light was thrown on
a minute mirror an eighth of an inch in diameter
and the light reflected on to a scale by means of
which the signal was interpreted into letters. This
necessitated one person constantly scanning the spot
of light as it moved to the right and to the left of
the scale and calling out the individual letters, which
were taken down by another person. This tedious
and trying method of receiving signals was superceded
by another device of Lord Kelvin, the siphon
recorder.</p>

<p>The siphon, by which the cable signals are
automatically recorded, is a thin glass tube, about
the thickness of a strong linen thread, and quite
flexible. It is suspended in a frame and attached
by a single silk fibre to one side of a rectangular coil
of fine insulated wire, moving about a soft iron bar
fixed in the magnetic field of two large permanent<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_219">219</a></span>
magnets. The coil is held down at the lower end by
a silk thread, fastened to an adjustable spring, to
regulate or confine the lateral motion of the siphon,
the magnets are placed vertically and are two inches
apart, one end of the siphon is twice bent at right
angles, and dips into an ink well filled with filtered
aniline ink. The other end has a minute thread or
short piece of soft iron cemented longitudinally to
it, and sways in close proximity to a narrow fillet of
paper five-eighths of an inch wide, which is drawn
along by a small motor. The small motors by
which the paper is drawn along receive their current
generally from lead-lined trays, 18 by 20 inches, at
the bottom of which is placed a copper sheet, the
zinc is wrapped in stout manilla paper which serves
the purpose of a porous cup for the sulphate of copper.
The cable current passes through the small
rectangular coil, which is about two inches long, as
both positive and negative currents are sent into
the condensers, and thereby disturb the static electricity
of the cable. The coil is deflected to the
right and left respectively, tending to place itself at
right angles to the lines of magnetic force between
the fixed bar magnets and which lines of force are
concentrated by the small bar above mentioned
of the best soft iron within the coil. The siphon
has, therefore, a corresponding motion to the coil.
As the mechanical force of the suspended coil is very
small in deflecting, it is necessary that the siphon<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_220">220</a></span>
be not in continuous contact with the fillet of paper
otherwise its motion would cease. The difficulty of
obtaining a record is overcome in an ingenious manner.
The siphon is made to vibrate by means of a
local battery on the principle of the push button electric
bell by the breaking of the circuit&mdash;the vibration
is communicated to the siphon by the interposition
of another electro-magnet in the local circuit and
placed underneath the fillet of paper, the small
thread of iron on the tip of the siphon acts as the
armature to the latter electro-magnet. The number
of vibrations made in a second depends on the
siphon, different siphons having different periods or
inherent notes, but 55 is about the number of vibrations
a second, every pulsation of the siphon deposits
a drop of ink on the paper, and, as the paper is
moving at the rate of over half an inch a second, an
apparently continuous line is drawn.</p>

<p>From the description of the working of the siphon&mdash;of
its lateral movements&mdash;it will be evident that
the cablegram, as shown on the fillet of paper, will
look like the contour line across the Rocky Mountains.
The undulations made by the siphon correspond
to the clicking we hear in the ordinary telegraph
instruments. A cable office is very quiet compared
to the bewildering clatter in a large telegraph office.</p>

<p>It was found that on the Atlantic (and shorter
cables) a greater speed of signals was possible than
could be sent through by hand with the double<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_221">221</a></span>
key. This called forth the invention of the so-called
automatic transmitter.</p>

<p>For this purpose the messages are in the first
place punched into a strip of oiled and prepared
paper, the characters on the strip are represented by
holes at varying distances on each side of a central
line. This strip of continuous paper is then fed into
the transmitter, in which metallic points slide along
the under side of the strip. Wherever a hole is encountered
electric contact is made and a signal sent.
The speed of running the strip through the transmitter
can be regulated as desired.</p>

<p>The “auto” can easily keep two men busy punching.</p>

<p>Within recent years an improvement has been
effected for transmitting signals or messages automatically
from one cable to another. Formerly it was
necessary after receiving the signals from one cable
to transmit them by hand to the connecting cable
at the station. Now, however, this can be done automatically
by means of Taylor, Brown and Dearlove’s
Translator. The siphon in it instead of carrying ink
contains a metallic thread which rests, instead of on
the fillet of paper, on a rapidly, revolving, perfectly,
smooth, small wheel, in which the surface of the
circumference is divided into three parts, the central
one known as “no man’s land” being a non-conductor
such as glass, while the outer ones are of
silver. As the siphon sways to one side or the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_222">222</a></span>
other it makes metallic contact, which is communicated
by means of “brushes” which press
against each side of the wheel to the outgoing cable.</p>

<p>This translator simplifies the work and reduces
the office staff which would be otherwise necessary.</p>

<p>At the present time nearly all cables use the
duplex system, that is, messages can be sent and received
at the same time on one wire.</p>

<p>The speed of a cable is given in words per minute,
the conventional number of five letters per word
being understood, though in actual practice, owing
to the extensive use of special codes, the number of
letters per word is really between eight and nine,
and this forms a considerable factor in the earning
capacity of the cable, but the speed depends upon
the length of the cable and the experience of the
operator. Tests made over the Vancouver and
Fanning Island section of the Pacific cable give 85
letters per minute with hand working and 100 letters
a minute with automatic curb working, and
approximately 168 letters a minute (84 letters each
way) with duplex and curbed automatic working.
This section of the cable is 3,455 nautical miles in
length, the longest cable that has ever been laid,
and about twice the length of the Atlantic cables.
On shorter cables a greater speed can be attained.</p>

<h3><i>Cyrus W. Field.</i></h3>

<p>Born in 1819, at Stockbridge, Mass., at the age of
fifteen, he left home and became a clerk in a leading
house in New York. At twenty-one he married
and settled down in life as a wholesale paper merchant.
Having been very successful he wished to
retire, but yielded to the wishes of his junior partner
and allowed his name to remain as the head of the
firm. He withdrew, however, so far as to make a
six months’ tour to South America, returning in
1853.</p>

<p>He was led to turn his attention to ocean telegraphy
through an interview with Mr. Gisborne,
who was then engaged in constructing a telegraph
line across the Island of Newfoundland, and laying
a submarine cable from there to Nova Scotia, in
connection with a projected line of steamships to
Ireland. It struck him that if a cable of such length
could be laid there was nothing to hinder a still
longer being carried from one side of the Atlantic
to the other. Turning over this thought in his mind
he consulted with Professor Morse and Lieutenant
Maury, and receiving encouragement from them he
devoted his energies in the enterprise in conjunction
with his brother Dudley.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_224">224</a></span>
Other friends joined him, and the first Atlantic
Telegraph Company was organized with a favorable
charter, granting them the sole right for fifty years
of landing a telegraph cable on Newfoundland and
with a subsidy as soon as the line was completed.</p>

<p>The first thing was to connect the Continent with
Newfoundland. This part of the scheme was successfully
accomplished in 1856.</p>

<p>The next step was the formation of the Atlantic
Telegraph Company and the sounding the way for
the cable which was undertaken by both the British
and American Governments separately. The British
Government gave every encouragement to the projectors
by promising £14,000 a year for the transmission
of its messages and the use of the ships of its
navy to lay the cable.</p>

<p>£350,000 was asked for and in a short time subscribed,
Mr. Field taking 80 shares of £1,000 each.</p>

<p>In 1857 the first attempt to lay the cable proved
a failure, but in the following year (1858) a second
attempt was made, but a terrific storm met the vessels
in the middle of the Atlantic, the cable broke
again and the expedition returned to England once
more. A third effort met with better success, and
on the 5th of August, 1858, the two ends were safely
landed, one in Valentia Bay, Ireland, the other in
Trinity Bay, Newfoundland.</p>

<p>The first message sent from the Old World to the
New was worthy the occasion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_225">225</a></span>
“Glory to God in the highest, on earth peace and
good-will to men.”</p>

<p>A few weeks later the cable ceased to act, but a
new cable was prepared and the “Great Eastern” was
sent out with it, only, however, to lose it also when
1,200 miles from Ireland.</p>

<p>It seemed a hopeless dream to bind the two worlds
by electric wire, but Mr. Field did not despair. A
better cable was once more made; another company
was formed with a capital of £600,000.</p>

<p>In 1866 the “Great Eastern” again sailed, and this
time carried the thin thread triumphantly from
shore to shore, not only so, but fished up the broken
cable from the abysses of the ocean, united it and
joined England and America by two telegraphic
wires.</p>

<p>The moving spirit throughout was Mr. Field, who
spent some thirteen years of his life and made forty
trips across the Atlantic, imperilling his health and
means in pursuit of this great enterprise before his
efforts were crowned with success.</p>

<p>He died on the 12th day of July, 1892.</p>

<h3><i>Michael Farady.</i></h3>

<p>The pupil of Sir Humphrey Davy, and himself the
greatest philosophical chemist of his time, was born
on the 22nd of September, 1791. The son of a
smith, who was unable to give him any better education
than that afforded by a common day-school in
the neighborhood, reading, writing and arithmetic
embraced all his training for life, so far as schools
were concerned; but he had that within him which
from these poor beginnings made a magnificent
end. A fondness for reading filled his mind with
miscellaneous knowledge and paved the way for all
that followed.</p>

<p>At thirteen he was apprenticed to a bookseller
and binder, but his heart was even thus early in
science rather than trade, and he paid more attention
to rude experiments than to his immediate
calling. A gentleman having taken him to hear
some of Sir Humphrey Davy’s last lectures at the
Royal Institution, Faraday wrote out the notes he
had taken in a quarto volume, and sent them to Sir
Humphrey Davy, with a letter asking that, if he
could, would he give him a chance of escaping from
trade to philosophy. The result was his employment
as an assistant in the laboratory of the Royal Institution<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_227">227</a></span>
in 1813, at the age of 22, after he had been a
bookseller for nine years.</p>

<p>From this time Faraday’s progress was rapid. In
1820 his name was first made prominent for chemical
discoveries, and from that date every year recorded
some new research and new triumph, till in 1832 his
eminence was so thoroughly felt that the University
of Oxford made him a D.&nbsp;C.&nbsp;L., and in 1835 Lord
Melbourne’s Government gave him a pension of
£300 a year. Honours meanwhile were showered
upon him; he became one of eight foreign associates
of the Imperial Academy of Science at Paris, a commander
of the Legion of Honour, a knight of the
Prussian Order of Merit and member of numerous
scientific bodies in Europe and America.</p>

<p>The secret of his success, apart from his genius,
lay in his wonderful industry and calm and careful
attention to every detail of what he essayed.</p>

<p>In electricity and magnetism his researches made
him one of the foremost; his language in lecturing
was always simple; his experiments convincing, and
his enthusiasms so catching, that every one felt engrossed
by subjects which so absorbed the lecturer.</p>

<p>He was a true philosopher, taking nothing for
granted, and thinking nothing too insignificant to
follow out to the utmost. Many books have been
written on his discoveries, and several on his life and
character, but it is felt that no one who did not
know him could realize the man as he was.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_228">228</a></span>
With a European fame his was modest as a child.
The greatest authority in his day on natural science,
he was a humble Christian.</p>

<p>Faraday never married. When he died in 1867
his pension was continued to his maiden sister, who
survived him.</p>

<p>In Faraday, as in others, genius seemed largely to
be what Carlyle calls it, only a faculty of infinite
labor.</p>

<h3><i>Lord Kelvin.</i></h3>

<p>Born at Belfast, Ireland, 26th June, 1824, his
father being then teacher of mathematics in the
Royal Academical Institution. In 1832 James
Thomson accepted the chair of mathematics at Glasgow
and migrated there with his two sons, James
and William, who in 1834 matriculated in that University,
William being little more than ten years of
age, and having acquired all his education through
his father’s instruction.</p>

<p>In 1841 William Thomson entered Cambridge;
in 1845 took his degrees, second wrangler, to which
honour he added that of the first Smith’s prize.</p>

<p>At that time there was few facilities for the study
of experimental science in Great Britain. At the
Royal Institution Faraday held a unique position, and
was feeling his way almost alone.</p>

<p>In Cambridge science had progressed little since
the days of Newton. Thomson, therefore had recourse
to Paris and for a year worked in the laboratory
of Regnault, who was engaged in his classical
researches on the thermal properties of steam; but
his stay in Paris was comparatively short, for in 1846,
when only twenty-two years of age, he accepted the
chair of Natural Philosophy in the University of
Glasgow, which he filled for fifty-three years, attaining<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_230">230</a></span>
universal recognition as one of the greatest physicists
of his time.</p>

<p>The Glasgow chair was a source of inspiration to
scientific men for half a century, and many of the
most advanced researches grew out of the suggestions
which Thomson scattered as sparks from the
anvil.</p>

<p>Although his contributions to thermo-dynamics
may properly be regarded as his most scientific work,
it is in the field of electricity, especially in its application
to submarine telegraphy, that Lord Kelvin is
best known.</p>

<p>From 1854 he is most prominent among telegraphists.
The stranded form of the conductor was
due to his suggestion, but it was in the letters which he
addressed in November and December of that year
to Prof. Stokes, and which were published in the
proceedings of the Royal Society for 1855 that he
discussed the mathematical theory of signalling
through submarine cables, and enunciated the conclusion
that in long cables retardation due to capacity
must render the speed of signalling inversely proportional
to the square of the cable’s length.</p>

<p>Some held that if this were true ocean telegraphy
would be impossible, and sought in consequence to
disprove Thomson’s conclusions. Thomson on the
other hand set to work to overcome the difficulty
by improvement in the manufacture of the cables,
and first of all the production of copper of high conductivity,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_231">231</a></span>
and the construction of apparatus which
would readily respond to the slightest variation of
the current in the cable.</p>

<p>The mirror galvanometer and the siphon recorder,
which was patented in 1867, were the outcome of
these researches, but the scientific value of the mirror
galvanometer is independent of its use in telegraphy,
and the siphon recorder is the direct precursor of
one form of galvanometer (d’arsnovals), now commonly
used in electric laboratories.</p>

<p>Thomson’s work in connection with telegraphy led
to the production in rapid succession of instruments
adapted to the requirements of the time, for measurements
of every electrical quantity, and when electric
lighting came to the front, a new set of instruments
was produced to meet the needs of the electrical
engineer.</p>

<p>His industry is universal, and he seems to take
rest by turning from one difficulty to another, difficulties
that would appal most men, and be taken as
an enjoyment by no one else.</p>

<p>This life of unwearied industry and of universal
honour has left Lord Kelvin with a lovable nature,
and charms all with whom he comes in contact.</p>

<p>In 1866 he received the honour of knighthood in
acknowledgment of his services to transatlantic
telegraphy, and in 1892 he was raised to the peerage,
with the title of Baron Kelvin of Largs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_232">232</a></span></p>

<h3><i>John Watkins Brett.</i></h3>

<p>Telegraph engineer, was the son of a cabinet-maker,
William Brett, of Bristol, England, and was
born in that city in 1805.</p>

<p>Brett has been styled, and with apparent justice,
the founder of submarine telegraphy.</p>

<p>The idea of sending electricity through submerged
cables originated with him and his brother; after
some years in perfecting his plans, he sought and
obtained permission from Louis Phillipe in 1847 to
establish telegraphic communication with France and
England, but the project did not receive public attention,
being regarded as too hazardous for general
support.</p>

<p>The attempt was, however, made in 1850, and
met with success, and the construction of numerous
other submarine lines followed.</p>

<p>Brett always expressed confidence in the ultimate
union of England and America by means of electricity,
but did not live to see its final success.</p>

<p>He died on 3rd December, 1863, at the age of 58.</p>

<p>Brett published a book of 104 pages on the origin
and progress of oceanic telegraphy. He also contributed
several papers on the same subject to the
Institute of Civil Engineers, of which he was a
member.</p>

<p>A list of these contributions will be found in the
index of the Proceedings of the Society.</p>

<h3><i>Signor Guiglielmo Marconi.</i></h3>

<p>Born at Marzabotta, near Bologna, Italy, in April,
1875. His father was a native of Italy and a man
of substance, his mother was a Miss Jamieson, born
in Ireland, but of Scottish lineage.</p>

<p>Young Marconi early turned his attention to the
wonders of electricity and began his experiments in
wireless telegraphy in 1891. While yet a mere lad
he came to England in 1896, and in co-operation
with Sir William Preece, then the head of the telegraph
department in England, began further experiments.</p>

<p>On March 27, 1899, he succeeded in sending messages
across the British channel from Boulogne to
the south foreland.</p>

<p>The next and greatest achievement of all, on
December 12, 1901, he received a signal at St. John’s,
Nfld., from Poldhu, Cornwall, nearly 2,000 miles distant.</p>

<p>On February 26, 1902, he received messages
aboardship on the Atlantic ocean from Poldhu, 2,099
miles away.</p>

<p>He is now engaged in further experiments and
hopes to establish permanent communication between
England and America within a very short<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_234">234</a></span>
time, and later extend the system over the entire
globe.</p>

<p>At the present time all the leading steamship
lines crossing the Atlantic, and many ships of the
British navy, are equipped with wireless telegraph
apparatus, by means of which vessels at sea are in
constant touch with Europe and America; thus each
ship has become a floating telegraph office.</p>

<p>The inventor is somewhat above medium height
and of a highly strung temperament. He is quiet
and deliberate in his movements; he talks little; is
straightforward, unassuming, and has accepted his
success with calmness, almost with unconcern.</p>

<p>He is undoubtedly the most prominent man of
the day and the wonder of the age.</p>

<h3><i>Genesis of Wireless Telegraphy.</i></h3>

<p>Professor McBride, M.A., D.Sc., of McGill University,
in his inaugural address as President of the
Natural History Society of Montreal in October,
1901, referred to wireless telegraphy as <span class="locked">follows:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“Take a discovery that is exciting the greatest
interest at the present time, and promises results of
the most far-reaching importance, namely, wireless
telegraphy. Let us trace the apostolical succession,
to borrow a term from theology, of the idea which
underlies the discovery.</p>

<p>“Thirty or forty years ago the great Cambridge
physicist, Clerk Maxwell, one of the greatest and
most penetrative of the geniuses who have filled the
chairs of that ancient university, was engaged in determining
the value of the electric unit. As many
of my hearers are aware, there are two ways of doing
this: we can estimate either the push that an electric
charge exerts on another similar charge, or else the
pull that an electric current effects on a magnetic
needle. In this way two different values for the
unit are arrived at, and the relation between them,
or to put it more simply, the number obtained by
dividing the one by the other, gives the velocity of
light in centimeters per second. This remarkable result
suggested to Clerk Maxwell that, that mysterious
thing called electricity had something to do with the
ether which fills all space and transmits the vibrations<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_236">236</a></span>
which we call light, and he thereupon constructed
this famous electro-magnetic theory of light
which conceives light to consist of vibrations not on
a comparatively gross material like ordinary matter,
but of electricity itself. This theory received at first
little support from the German physicists, who are
inclined to scoff at every idea that is not of German
origin.</p>

<p>“Amongst a crowd of scoffers, however, one open-minded
enquirer was found who said to himself
‘If Clerk Maxwell is right, I ought to find that if I
start artificial electric vibrations they will propagate
themselves like light waves.’ This man’s name was
Hertz, and he promptly set about producing electric
waves purely with a view of testing Clerk Maxwell’s
theory.</p>

<p>“He had many difficulties to overcome before he
succeeded in producing them in sufficiently rapid
succession, but this was at last accomplished and
Maxwell’s theory triumphantly vindicated.</p>

<p>“The electric vibrations comported themselves
like light. It is true that a stone wall was as
transparent for them as a sheet of glass is for ordinary
light, but they were reflected by a metal plate and
could be brought to a focus, etc., etc. Now this invisible
light, as we may call it, is what Marconi and
others have employed in their so-called wireless
telegraphy, but, without Maxwell or Hertz, it would
have remained undiscovered to this day.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_237">237</a></span></p>

<h3><i>Historical.</i></h3>

<p>Wireless telegraphy, or the transmission of signals
through space by means of electric waves, is of a
comparatively recent origin, although the idea of the
existence of electric waves dates back some forty
years ago.</p>

<p>In 1868 Clerk Maxwell, then Professor of Physics
in Cambridge University, first published a theory
showing that an intimate relation between electricity
and light existed. This theory, which has received
most conclusive substantiation since then by eminent
physicists, is known as the electro-magnetic theory.
It tells us that electric waves and light waves are
similar; that they represent a transfer of energy by
means of the all-pervading universal ether; that
they differ radically in their effects on the physical
senses in wave length and period of vibration, and
that both possess the same velocity, 186,000 miles
per second.</p>

<p>Many of the exponents of the electro-magnetic
theory discussed the properties of electric waves long
before they were experimentally demonstrated.</p>

<p>Our experimental knowledge of the existence of
electric waves dates from about 1880.</p>

<p>Hertz, a German physicist, while working under
the illustrious Helmholtz, discovered that small<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_238">238</a></span>
sparks could be made to pass between the two conductors
when held near a circuit in which electric
oscillations were set up. He soon discovered that
this was due to the action of electric waves, and,
realizing how fundamental in importance this was to
the thorough knowledge of the electro-magnetic
theory, he commenced a series of experimental researches
which were of such a brilliant and productive
nature as to mark them as amongst the most
important investigations in the whole domain of
science.</p>

<p>A number of experimenters then followed, amongst
them Signor Marconi, who has since become closely
identified with its practical application.</p>

<p>In 1890 the coherer was discovered by Branly,
and simultaneously by Oliver Lodge.</p>

<p>Lodge’s coherer was a very delicate instrument,
and by its means the electric waves could be detected
at a much greater distance than was possible
with the conductors used by Hertz.</p>

<p>In 1895, in Cambridge, Mr. Rutherford (now
Professor of Physics in McGill University), first
showed that the waves could be observed by a
magnetic detector.</p>

<p>He discovered that a weakly magnetized steel
wire becomes instantaneously demagnetized under
the influence of electrical oscillations, such as electric
waves. With his detector he succeeded in establishing
communication at half a mile.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_239">239</a></span>
In 1896 Marconi came from Italy to England,
and, with the help of a Government grant, obtained
through the instigation of Sir William Preece, head
of the British telegraph department, commenced a
series of experiments in wireless telegraphy. Very
rapid strides were made, and the distance to which
signals could be sent was very much increased.</p>

<p>An important development soon followed in regard
to the use of a vertical wire for transmitting
the waves, instead of a horizontal one, which increased
the distance still more.</p>

<p>Although Marconi has come to be chiefly associated
with the development of wireless telegraphy,
other systems have been established in various countries
which involve slight modifications in the
apparatus employed.</p>

<p>In Germany the Arco Slaby system is used with
success, and in the United States the De Forest is
being installed in many places.</p>

<p>Then there is the Armstrong, Orling and the
Muirhead Lodge system. In England a wireless
telegraph company was organized in 1902.</p>

<p>This company, having secured the Marconi patents,
aimed to monopolize that business in Great Britain,
but, as the Government there controls the telegraphs,
this was not permitted.</p>

<p>The company complained as to the attitude of the
British Government in retarding instead of encouraging
the enterprise. When the subject was brought<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_240">240</a></span>
up in the House of Commons on June 8, 1903, Mr.
Chamberlain, the then Postmaster-General, explained
that he had no desire to hamper a new invention,
but the Post-Office did not intend to throw away its
right to the monopoly in public communication as it
had done in the early days of the telephone.</p>

<p>He had not been dealing with Mr. Marconi, but
with the company owning Marconi’s invention. The
company asked for a permanent exclusive right to
use wireless telegraphy in Great Britain.</p>

<p>This was refused, on the ground that it was not
business. When the company was prepared to talk
business, he was prepared to deal with it. When the
company asked for a private wire to Poldhu he (Mr.
Chamberlain) had granted the request immediately.</p>

<p>At the time President Roosevelt sent his wireless
message to King Edward, and the latter replied by
cable, the Post-Office had arranged to convey the
message from the nearest office to Poldhu at any
hour, although there was no difference whatever in
telegraphing from London to Poldhu.</p>

<p>The company next asked the Post-Office to act as
its agent in collecting messages in Great Britain for
transatlantic marconigraphing, but he had submitted
certain conditions with the view of preventing interference
with the admiralty and for strategic reasons,
adding that when the conditions were accepted and
the company satisfied the Post-Office experts of its<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_241">241</a></span>
ability to send messages across the Atlantic, the
Post-Office would appoint the company as its agent,
as it already had done in the case of the cable companies.</p>

<p>That letter had been sent to the company on March
31, but no reply had been received.</p>

<p>Mr. Chamberlain contended that the Post-Office
was in no way to be blamed for the delay, but it refused
to take the public money for messages until
the company was willing to allow the Post-Office experts
to go to Poldhu and satisfy themselves that the
wireless system is workable. All this shows the
company was not at that time in a position to transact
public business, otherwise the Post-Office experts
would have had access to its station at Poldhu. The
subsequent failure showed the contention of the Post-Office
was correct.</p>

<p>In the early part of 1903 a transatlantic communication
was established for a short time and then
collapsed; the system not having been fully perfected,
the company should hesitate to again make the attempt
until its plans are fully matured. As to the
future of the system there is not the shadow of a
doubt of its ultimate success. Meanwhile the Marconi
Company has arranged with the British Government
Telegraph System and also with the leading
Telegraph companies in the United States and
Canada to interchange traffic. Now nearly all passenger
steamers crossing the Atlantic are equipped<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_242">242</a></span>
with the Marconi apparatus and are in a position
while at sea to send and receive messages to and from
all parts of the world, and the company are doing a
profitable business even now with its limited area of
operations; what must it be when they shall have
established communication over every sea and continent
in the world. This will be accomplished in no
very long lapse of time. The medium of communication
provided by nature is ready and waiting like a
willing steed to be harnessed for the uses of man.</p>

<p>The man singled out by providence to perform this
superhuman task is Signor Guiglielmo Marconi.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_243">243</a></span></p>

<h3><i>Wireless Telegraphy Apparatus.</i></h3>

<p>Electric waves have long been harnessed by the
use of wires for sending communications to a distance,
but the ether exists outside of the wire as well
as within; therefore, having the ether everywhere,
it must be possible to produce waves in it which will
pass anywhere on the earth’s surface, and if these
waves can be controlled, messages can be transmitted
as easily and certainly as the ether within the guiding
wire. The problem lay in producing suitable instruments
to effect this result. Marconi adopted a
device invented by an Italian named Calzecchi, and
improved by a Frenchman, Mr. Branley, called the
coherer, which he greatly improved. This instrument
is merely a small tube of glass about as big around
as a lead pencil and two inches in length; this is
plugged at each end with silver. The plugs almost
touching within the tube, the narrow space between
is filled with finely powdered particles of nickel and
silver, which possess the property of being alternately
good and very bad conductors of an electric current
or waves. The waves that come from the transmitter,
perhaps a thousand or two thousand miles away, are
received, but are so weak that they could not of
themselves actuate any ordinary telegraph instrument;
they do, however, possess strength enough to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_244">244</a></span>
draw the little fragments of silver and nickel in the
coherer together in a continuous path; in other
words, they make these metal filings cohere, and the
moment they cohere they become a good conductor
for electricity, and a current from a local battery
operates the Morse instruments. Then a little tapper
actuated by the same current strikes against the
coherer, the particles of metal are separated or decohered,
becoming instantly a poor conductor and thus
stopping the current from the home battery; another
wave comes through space into the coherer there
drawing the particles again together and another dot
or dash is printed. All these processes are continued
rapidly until a complete message is received.</p>

<p>The sending instrument, or transmitter, is called
the oscillator, a device somewhat similar to the
familiar Morse telegraph key.</p>

<p>Marconi is now employed in perfecting an instrument
by which the station only with which communication
is desired can hear the signal, and receive
the message. Thus the required secrecy will
be preserved.</p>

<p>Marconi has patented over a hundred devices in
connection with wireless telegraphy, but the nature
and application of these has not been given to the
public as yet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_245">245</a></span></p>

<h3><i>Thomas A. Edison’s Opinion of Wireless Telegraphy.</i></h3>

<p>“There is absolutely no reason why Marconi may
not develop a speed of 500 words a minute in the
transmission of translantic messages,” said Thomas
A. Edison in course of an interview; “on the other
hand,” continued the inventor, “there are technical,
scientific and mechanical obstacles which make it
absolutely impossible to increase the speed of transmission
of ocean cables.</p>

<p>“There is not the least doubt but that the Marconi
system is successful. All this talk about lack of
secrecy and interception of messages is nonsense. At
least ten men know the contents of every cable
message, and none of them receive very high salary.
Personally I have no doubt whatever that the Marconi
system is both a commercial and scientific
success.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_246">246</a></span></p>

<h3><i>A Cable Manager’s Views of Wireless Telegraphy.</i></h3>

<p>At the annual meeting of the Commercial Cable
Company on March 3, 1903, Mr. Ward, the Vice-President
and General Manager, referring to wireless
telegraphy, said: “At the last annual meeting
some remarks were made by me in regard to wireless
telegraphy and its effects upon submarine cables.
We see no reason to change the opinion expressed
at that time.</p>

<p>“Admitting the recent transmission of a message
across the Atlantic without wires, radical improvements
would have to be made in its development
before wireless telegraphy could possibly hope to
meet the demands of trade and commerce, and engage
in successful competition with submarine cables.</p>

<p>“A good deal has been said and advertised about
the wireless systems for the past three years. As
yet there is nothing to show that messages can be
transmitted without wires even across short distances
with anything of the regularity, reliability,
correctness and secrecy at any time and all time
during the day or night demanded of the present
telegraph systems, and necessary for the protection,
interests and the development of the telegraph business.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_247">247</a></span>
“Furthermore, the transmission of messages between
European and American coasts of the Atlantic
is far from constituting a transatlantic service as it
exists to-day.</p>

<p>“The essential adjunct of an extensive inland system
for the distribution and collection of messages
on the North American Continent must not be lost
sight of. A large part of the traffic passing by the
Atlantic cables is destined for places remote from the
seaboard. Messages to and from Chicago, St Louis,
San Francisco, Montreal, Toronto, Winnipeg, Ottawa,
Vancouver, etc., require and receive transmission
which are measured by minutes. This important
traffic would be practically extinguished if the sender
could not rely on extremely rapid and accurate service.</p>

<p>“For the benefit of those who do not share my
confidence I may say that the etheric waves will be
as obedient to us as to anybody, if it should ever be
found practicable to dispense with cables and wires.</p>

<p>“On the other hand, we have not been standing
still in the matter of improvements.</p>

<p>“The Commercial Cable Company will maintain
its pre-eminence, and has nothing to dread from the
competition of wire or wireless telegraphy. At the
same time we are satisfied it has its limits.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_248">248</a></span></p>

<h3><i>An Interview with Signor Marconi.</i></h3>

<p>The following interesting interview had with
Signor Marconi by a representative of the <cite>Montreal
Star</cite>, Sept. 10, 1903, is worth <span class="locked">reproducing:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“Seated in the rotunda of the Windsor Hotel to-day
was a slightly built man with a keen expressive
face and grey eyes that flashed incessantly. Probably
not one of the guests that thronged the
spacious lobby was aware that the little man sitting
there so quietly was Signor Guiglielmo Marconi,
the ‘Wizard of the Wireless.’</p>

<p>“Signor Marconi reached the city early to-day
from New York, where he has been for the past ten
days. He is now on his way to Ottawa, where he is
to have an interview with the Government in regard
to his future plans. When approached by a <cite>Star</cite>
reporter Signor Marconi chatted pleasantly of those
plans and gave some interesting information of what
had been done in the past and the prospects of the
future.</p>

<p>“He speaks English fluently with a slight accent,
and appears to be more eager to interview than be
interviewed.</p>

<p>“‘I am glad to be in Canada once more,’ said the
distinguished inventor. ‘Canadians have always<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_249">249</a></span>
been extremely interested in my work and I am
beginning to feel quite at home when I get here.’</p>

<p>“‘Do you know,’ he said with a smile, ‘that this
is my fourth visit to Canada?’</p>

<p>“‘What is the object of your present visit to
Canada?’</p>

<p>“‘I am here partly on a holiday trip and partly
on business. I am leaving for Ottawa to-night, and
while there I shall go into a matter I have long been
considering, but which as yet I have not been able to
accomplish, namely, the establishment of Canadian
stations for the transmission of overland messages.
These stations will reach from the Atlantic to the
Pacific, and I hope that in a short time the wireless
system of telegraphing communications will be
thoroughly tested and perfected overland.</p>

<p>“‘In case I obtain the permission I desire, I shall
begin operations as soon as possible, and Canada will
offer exceptional advantages for the testing of the
system by reason of its tremendous distances.’</p>

<p>“‘It is merely a matter of time, then, before these
stations are built and experiments begun?’</p>

<p>“‘Yes, merely a matter of time. There is one point
in regard to wireless telegraphy that the general public
do not seem to grasp quite, and that point is the
length of time that must be taken up by the incessant
private experiments in order that the system may be
perfected. One cannot go at matters of this sort too
quickly; each step has to be thought out carefully,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_250">250</a></span>
and often weeks are spent in perfecting some little
detail; the progress of the work is, therefore, slow.’</p>

<p>“‘Can you tell me anything of the negotiations
you are conducting with the British Admiralty?’</p>

<p>“‘All I can say is that a contract between myself
and the British Admiralty has already been signed
and sealed for the adoption of the Marconi system on
all the ships of the navy. Sixty-three of the battleships
are already fitted up with the apparatus and
the whole of the navy is to be equipped.’</p>

<p>“‘The terms of the contract will allow me to use
the different stations of the navy for the erection of
my receiving station and my masts; negotiations
have been going on for some time, and now everything
is arranged and the British navy will be
equipped with the Marconi wireless apparatus.’</p>

<p>“The distinguished inventor then gave a very
lucid description of the effectiveness of the wireless
agency over marine areas; the unbroken surface of
the ocean enabled great distances to be obtained.</p>

<p>“In regard to the overland service, if the land
was low lying, the same conditions prevailed as at
sea. Over tracts, where the usual diversified
topographical features were found, the potency of
the vibrations might be reduced. The vibrations
seemed to reach farther in fogs than in a clear
atmosphere, but, as a rule, atmospheric conditions
did not appear to affect the transmission of messages.
In regard to the location of stations Signor Marconi<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_251">251</a></span>
said that proximity to the sea was desirable for a
station, as some geological formations were perverse
and others responsive.</p>

<p>“Before his return to England he would visit Cape
Breton and his Receiving Station at Glace Bay.</p>

<p>“He expected to be in Canada for some weeks.</p>

<p>“Signor Marconi spoke of the voyage he made on
the ‘Campania’ a few days ago. On that trip the
‘Campania’ was in constant touch with Poldhu
until nearing the Coast of America, when she picked
up the Narraganset Station.</p>

<p>“Throughout the voyage a daily bulletin was
issued of the world’s leading events, and the result of
the yacht races were known on board a few minutes
after the conclusion of the various races.</p>

<p>“A few minutes’ chat with the ‘wizard’ is convincing
proof that the distinguished inventor has
implicit faith in the future of his system.</p>

<p>“The great tone of assurance in which he speaks
is only equalled by the modest way in which he refers
to the marvellous results that have been obtained
already.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_252">252</a></span></p>

<h3><i>The Trip of the SS. “Minneapolis.”</i></h3>

<p>“Signor Marconi has scored another triumph with
his wireless telegraphy.</p>

<p>“The passengers on the Atlantic Transport Company’s
steamship ‘Minneapolis,’ which reached
London on Tuesday, enjoyed the distinction of being
the first transatlantic travellers to keep in touch with
the rest of the world throughout their voyage from
the New to the Old World.</p>

<p>“The ‘Minneapolis’ left New York on January 31,
and for five days kept in touch with the Cape Cod
Station; after that the wireless plant began to respond
to the messages at Cornwall.</p>

<p>“The varying phases of the Venezuelan question,
the domestic troubles of European potentates, the
definition of true philanthropy by John E. Rockfeller,
jun., King Edward’s illness, the contest for the Fair
millions, the hurricane that destroyed 1,000 inhabitants
of the Society Islands, Sir Thomas’ latest
plans, Count Montesquious’ New York debut, the
latest gossip from Washington and St. James’, these
were among the tit-bits of news that varied the
monotony to ocean travel.</p>

<p>“When the English pilot picked up the ‘Minneapolis’
his two-day old newspapers were accepted
with disdain, and he was informed of the latest news
that had been flashed to the liner.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_253">253</a></span></p>

<h3><i>Valuable Use of Marconi System made by Disabled Steamer.</i></h3>

<p class="sigright">
Queenstown, Dec. 10, 1903.
</p>

<p>The saloon passengers of the steamer “Kroonland”
are enthusiastic over the utility of the Marconi
wireless telegraph system, by means of which
news of the accident to that ship was received here
yesterday.</p>

<p>The breakdown of the steering apparatus occurred
at noon Tuesday, when the “Kroonland”
was 130 miles west of Fastnet. Captain Daxrud
immediately sent to Crookhaven a wireless message
to the agents of the line at Antwerp describing the
damage and informing them that the steamer must
abandon her voyage. A reply was received within
an hour and a half. Whereupon Captain Daxrud
complied with the instructions sent to him to return
to Queenstown. Meanwhile, three-fourths of the
saloon passengers and a number of those in the
second cabin sent wireless messages to friends in
various parts of Great Britain and Europe, and many
of them received replies before Fastnet was sighted
from the steamer.</p>

<p>Some of the wireless messages were cabled to the
United States. In some cases the senders asked<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_254">254</a></span>
friends for money, and the replies authorizing the
purser to advance funds to them, which was done
before land was sighted.</p>

<p>The “Kroonland’s” twin screws steered the ship
easily, the only difference being steam was reduced.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_255">255</a></span></p>

<h3><i>Another Use of Wireless Telegraphy.</i></h3>

<p class="sigright">
New York, Oct. 17, 1903.
</p>

<p>Wireless telegraphy was successfully used in
tracing lost baggage on the last outward trip of the
Red Star Liner “Finland,” on Oct 10.</p>

<p>A passenger, who discovered some time after the
steamer’s departure, that he left some baggage behind
on the dock, communicated with the officials
at the Pier through the Marconi Station at Babylon,
L.I., and in twenty minutes received a reply that the
baggage had been found and would be forwarded by
the next steamer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_256">256</a></span></p>

<h3><i>A Newspaper’s Opinion of Wireless Telegraphy.</i></h3>

<p>The Montreal <cite>Witness</cite>, in its issue Nov. 18, 1903,
says: “Whatever may be the actual achievement of
the Marconi wireless system, so far as telegraphing
across the Atlantic is concerned, that system is now
an assured success in communicating from ship to
ship and from ships to lighthouses on the coasts. In
this respect the system has passed the stage of
scientific curiosity and has become a necessity.
The Cunard and Allan Lines now, for instance, are
able to communicate with stations established on the
south and northwest coasts of Ireland, so that their
owners as ‘Syren and Shipping’ puts it, are no
longer in a quandary during bad or thick weather
as to whether their boats are calling at Queenstown
or at Moville, as the case may be. The Marconi
system was first installed upon the ‘Lucania,’ and
so satisfied were the Cunard people with results that
it is now in regular operation on the ‘Campania,’
‘Etruria,’ ‘Umbria,’ ‘Ivernia,’ ‘Saxonia,’ ‘Aurania’
and ‘Carpothia.’</p>

<p>“Other shipping lines have similarly found the
Marconi system indispensable, so that now it is quite
an ordinary occurrence for a ship on the North
Atlantic to be in electrical communication with passing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_257">257</a></span>
steamers or the shore during nearly the whole of
the voyage.</p>

<p>“Such remarkable success as already attained is
sufficient warrant for the general belief that this system
of aerial telegraphy is but in its initial stages,
and that its commercial success over wider spaces is
only a question of time. Presently the system will
be used on the Canadian Coast line, and then it is
hoped that shipwreck caused by want of knowledge
of locality will be largely a thing of the past.”</p>

<h3><i>Wireless Telegraphy.</i></h3>

<p>There has been no announcement in connection
with science of recent date which has such an important
meaning as the very modest statement recently
made by Signor Marconi to the members of
the Royal Institute of London. His discoveries in
connection with wireless telegraphy have exceeded
the expectations of many of the greatest scientists of
the day who gave him all credit for the work which
he had done, but could not bring themselves to believe
that he could perfect his system within so brief
a time.</p>

<p>One of the principal handicaps which Mr. Marconi
has endeavored to overcome has been that of
rapid and reliable transmission of messages. For
a time he found it very difficult to mechanically record
messages which were transmitted with high
speed. It necessitated the use of a telephone receiver
which meant that the operator might take
down the message, but there was no mechanical record
which would cause a mistake in receiving it to
be instantly detected.</p>

<p>Mr. Marconi says: “I have perfected a receiver
which will permit the transmission and receiving of
messages at the rate of 100 words per minute on an
ordinary Wheatstone recorder. This obviates the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_259">259</a></span>
difficulty of relying upon the operator to take the
message by sound and permits of a double record of
every message received.”</p>

<p>The ability to transmit and correctly receive wireless
messages at this rate means that this latest invention
of science is now in a position whereby it
can compete on even terms with the great telegraph
and cable services of the world. Mr. Marconi further
stated that his new invention further combined
accuracy with absolute reliability, and it means that
the future development of wireless telegraphy has
received an impetus which will carry it into a broader
field than has heretofore been conservatively looked
for, and that this unlimited possibility can and will
be made an actuality in the immediate future.</p>

<p>No more important announcement could be made
at this time when Mr. Marconi is about to install the
new, high-powered apparatus which will allow uninterrupted
communication between Glace Bay, Nova
Scotia and Poldhu, England.</p>

<div id="ip_260" class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;"><img src="images/i_260.jpg" width="500" height="416" alt="" /><div class="caption">SS. PARISIAN.</div></div>

<h3><i>Wireless Telegraphy on the SS. “Parisian.”</i></h3>

<p>Through the courtesy of Major Fishback, Canadian
Manager for the Marconi Telegraph Company,
the writer had permission to visit the Marconi Cabin
on the SS. “Parisian” in order to learn the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">modus
operandi</i> of wireless telegraph at sea.</p>

<p>On boarding the ship the first object noticeable is
a wire leading from the cabin to the peak of the
main mast ending in a triangular form, connecting
the apparatus with the ether and another wire to
the ship’s hold going to earth.</p>

<p>Mr. McGee, the young man in charge, politely
pointed out and explained the uses of the various
appliances comprising the Marconi outfit.</p>

<p>First was a large Rumford coil, a glass cylinder
through which the electric spark was discharged
and a key or transmitter constituting the sending
apparatus.</p>

<p>Second, on the left was a large oblong box containing
the coherer, the chief instrument in wireless
telegraphy, and in the centre an automatic self-inking
Morse register with an alarm bell attachment,
these being the receiving instruments, and
underneath the accumulators or storage batteries
and six cells of a home battery to work the Morse<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_261">261</a></span>
instrument. When the key was depressed for an
instant a bright electric spark emitted from the contact
points in the glass cylinder, giving a hard hissing
sound; this imprinted a dot on the register, and
a longer impression marked a line, the two forming
the letter “a” of the Morse alphabet.</p>

<p>The characters or code used by the wireless system
is what is known as the European or Continental
Code, that is the spaced letters are eliminated and
dots and lines substituted the same as the cable
system.</p>

<p>All the vessels equipped with Marconi apparatus
on the St. Lawrence route have a capacity of eighty
miles’ transmission, but a possible one hundred and
twenty, this distance being deemed great enough for
all practical purposes.</p>

<p>On the New York and Liverpool route the steamships
have a much more extensive equipment, which
enables them to keep in touch with the one side of
the Atlantic or the other during the entire voyage.</p>

<p>The cost of the Marconi equipment of the former
averages £200&mdash;or $1,000.</p>

<p>Five Marconi stations have been erected on the
Lower St. Lawrence during the present summer and
a fair, profitable traffic carried on so far. These
stations will be closed during the winter, but a station
is being erected at Cape Race, Nfld., which will
be open throughout the year.</p>

<p>The rates charged is two dollars for ten words and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_262">262</a></span>
twelve cents for each additional word plus cable or
land line rates.</p>

<p>Mr. McGee informed me the “Parisian” was
enveloped in a dense fog when in the vicinity of
Belle Isle on her inward trip. The captain was surprised
at not hearing the fog syren and the Marconi
station was communicated with to learn the reason.
A response immediately came that the fog horn had
been and was then blowing since the fog had fallen,
thus showing the ship was out of range and in safety.</p>

<p>Many passengers took occasion to Marconigram
friends of their whereabouts and their probable
arrival at Montreal.</p>

<p>Passengers by the St. Lawrence route are now enabled
to communicate with friends three days after
departure and before arrival at Montreal by means
of the Marconi telegraph system. All the Marconi
stations are connected with the Canadian telegraphs.</p>

<p>Mr. McGee also stated this was his first trip as
operator with the Marconi Company.</p>

<p>He had attended the company’s Instructive School
in London for a period of three months, at the end
of which time he was considered duly qualified and
was appointed to the “Parisian.” This shows the wonderful
and mysterious wireless telegraphy is acquired
more rapidly than the Morse system, which takes
from six months to one year to become fairly proficient.</p>

<p>The operations of the one is very similar to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_263">263</a></span>
other; each ship or station has an individual call or
signal, and should the current affect any instruments
within range, no attention is given unless its own
particular signal is heard.</p>

<p>Many objections have been raised against wireless
telegraphy, for the reason that any one with a wireless
outfit could intercept a message.</p>

<p>The very same thing can be done on land by any
competent operator if he feels inclined to gratify his
curiosity and incur the penalty for so doing.</p>

<p>Taken altogether, the wireless system on shipboard
will prove an immense convenience to ocean travellers
and shipping interests, and will ensure greater
safety to both life and property.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_264">264</a></span></p>

<h3><i>The Future of Wireless Telegraphy.</i></h3>

<p>When, at the close of 1901, Marconi first announced
to the world his marvellous achievement
that he had received a signal from Poldhu at St.
John’s, Nfld., many were incredulous and doubted its
possibility, even many scientific men were sceptical
and suggested many reasons why there might be an
error in the experiment made. Amongst these were
Edison, Graham, Bell, Sir Wm. Preece and others
but, when the facts became known, all had to admit
the success of the experiment and the accuracy of
Marconi’s statement.</p>

<p>Mr. Edison became a warm believer in wireless
telegraphy, and is now identified with its development.
Soon after this triumph of the young Italian,
the voice of the company promoter was heard in the
land.</p>

<p>A wireless telegraph company was organized in
England. This company had the audacity to claim
an exclusive monopoly to operate the Marconi system,
but this the British authorities refused to grant.
Following this a company was formed for the same
purpose in the United States and one in Canada,
these being all more or less co-related.</p>

<p>The principal object being to establish wireless
communication between Europe and America, a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_265">265</a></span>
wireless station was erected at Glace Bay, Cape
Breton and one at Cape Cod, Mass., early in
1903. When these were completed communication
was for a short time carried on.</p>

<p>A congratulatory message from President Roosevelt
to King Edward was transmitted and a reply
returned by the King, but the system broke down
and it has so remained.</p>

<p>Mr. Marconi has been (ever since the mishap)
devoting his inventive genius to the perfecting of his
devices, and, it is believed, transatlantic communication
will be once more re-established within a very
short period. Meanwhile, these companies are not
standing still, but are very busily engaged in equipping
passenger steamships with Marconi wireless instruments,
enabling vessels to communicate with
each other or with the stations on land on either
side of the Atlantic. The wireless telegraph business
is constantly increasing and becoming very
lucrative. Traffic is now interchanged between the
British Government telegraph lines, the American
and Canadian telegraph companies and the wireless
companies, so that a message can now be sent from
any telegraph station to a person aboard ship, or
<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">vice versa</i>, by payment of the tolls required for each
company’s service. This seems to be naturally the
proper sphere for wireless telegraphy.</p>

<p>In time every ship that floats, whether naval or
mercantile, will eventually be installed with Marconi<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_266">266</a></span>
apparatus. This should be made one of the conditions
of insurance, if not compulsory. As far as being
successful competitors with existing land or cable
telegraph systems, it is more than doubtful, except in
places where no other telegraph system can be
maintained. Wireless telegraphy for a long time to
come will merely be auxiliary or supplementary
to the land and cable systems, and mutually
beneficial to each instead of being antagonistic.</p>

<p>The wireless system of telegraphy will be of immense
benefit to Canadian shipping interests owing
to the long stretch of river navigation from Montreal
to the Gulf.</p>

<p>Several minor stations have been erected recently
on the Lower St. Lawrence and are now working
satisfactorily.</p>

<p>The Canadian Government recognized the importance
of wireless telegraphy in its inception and
granted Marconi a substantial sum to enable him to
build his wireless station at Glace Bay. The
public hardly yet realize its great possibilities.</p>

  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.</li>

<p>1.F.</p>

<p>1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.</p>

<p>1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project

<p>1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.</p>

damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.</p>

electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.  </p>

<h3 class="pg">Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.</p>

<p>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org.</p>

<h3 class="pg">Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</p>

<p>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/donate">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.</p>

<p>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>

<p>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>

<p>Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate</p>

<h3 class="pg">Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.</h3>

<p>Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org</p>

<p>This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</p>
